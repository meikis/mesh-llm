# mesh-llm-ffi

`mesh-llm-ffi` exposes the Mesh client SDK through a native FFI layer for
language bindings.

This crate is the bridge used by the generated Swift and Kotlin SDKs. It should
stay thin and map the public Rust API from `crates/mesh-llm-api/` into an FFI-safe surface.

Layering:

- `crates/mesh-client/` implements low-level client behavior
- `crates/mesh-llm-api/` defines the public Rust SDK
- `crates/mesh-llm-ffi/` adapts that SDK for cross-language consumers

The FFI layer should expose public model ids as the same full model refs used by
mesh and `/v1/models`; it should not derive identities from GGUF filenames.

Application code should usually depend on `crates/mesh-llm-api/` directly unless it is
building a non-Rust binding.
