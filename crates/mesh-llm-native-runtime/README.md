# mesh-llm-native-runtime

Shared native runtime manifest, resolver, cache, and loading-plan policy for
MeshLLM.

This crate owns the code that decides which native runtime artifact should be
used for the current host. It is intentionally small and dependency-light so the
same policy can be reused by the CLI, installers, autoupdate, and future SDK
entry points.

## Concepts

A **native runtime** is a version-matched release artifact that contains the
platform-specific patched llama.cpp/Skippy shared libraries needed by MeshLLM,
such as a CPU, Metal, CUDA, CUDA Blackwell, ROCm, or Vulkan runtime.

Native runtimes are separate from the `mesh-llm` binary:

- `mesh-llm` is released once per OS/architecture.
- Native runtimes are released per MeshLLM version, OS/architecture, and
  runtime flavor.
- The native runtime `mesh_version` must match the running MeshLLM version.
- Runtime selection is based on a host profile and the release manifest, not on
  shell installer heuristics.

The resolver never builds native runtimes. It only selects, locates, installs,
or describes released artifacts.

## Artifact Manifest

Each packaged runtime directory contains `manifest.json`. The crate accepts two
equivalent shapes:

```json
{
  "artifact": {
    "native_runtime_id": "meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cuda",
    "mesh_version": "0.68.0",
    "target_triple": "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
    "os": "linux",
    "arch": "x86_64",
    "flavor": "cuda",
    "library_paths": ["lib/libggml.so", "lib/libllama-common.so", "lib/libmtmd.so", "lib/libllama.so"]
  }
}
```

Release-packaged native runtime artifacts use the direct shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "artifact_id": "meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cuda",
  "native_runtime_id": "meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cuda",
  "mesh_version": "0.68.0",
  "target_triple": "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
  "platform": "linux-x86_64",
  "os": "linux",
  "arch": "x86_64",
  "backend": "cuda",
  "flavor": "cuda",
  "library": "lib/libllama.so",
  "library_paths": ["lib/libggml.so", "lib/libllama-common.so", "lib/libmtmd.so", "lib/libllama.so"],
  "library_sha256": "7c2b...",
  "skippy_abi_version": "0.1.24",
  "requirements": []
}
```

Important fields:

- `native_runtime_id`: stable artifact ID used for cache paths and explicit
  selection.
- `mesh_version`: required exact MeshLLM version for this runtime.
- `target_triple`: optional Rust target triple. When both the artifact and host
  profile have a target triple, they must match exactly.
- `os` and `arch`: compared against `std::env::consts::OS` and
  `std::env::consts::ARCH` values from the host profile, for example `linux` /
  `x86_64` or `macos` / `aarch64`.
- `flavor`: runtime flavor. Built-in flavors are `cpu`, `metal`, `cuda`,
  `cuda-blackwell`, `rocm`, and `vulkan`. Unknown flavor strings are preserved
  as `NativeRuntimeFlavor::Other`.
- `priority`: optional rank adjustment. Higher compatible ranks win.
- `url`: optional archive URL used when the runtime is not already installed or
  supplied as a bundle directory.
- `sha256`: optional archive SHA-256 used by callers that download artifacts.
- `library_paths`: runtime-relative library paths used by the load-plan
  boundary.
- `requirements`: optional host requirements. Today this supports GPU display
  name matching through `gpu_name_contains`; compute capability and driver
  fields are reserved in the schema for stricter future checks.

## Release Manifest

Release manifests list the runtime artifacts available for a MeshLLM release:

```json
{
  "mesh_version": "0.68.0",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "native_runtime_id": "meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cpu",
      "mesh_version": "0.68.0",
      "target_triple": "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
      "os": "linux",
      "arch": "x86_64",
      "flavor": "cpu",
      "url": "https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/releases/download/v0.68.0/meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cpu.tar.gz",
      "sha256": "2f1c...",
      "library_paths": ["lib/libggml.so", "lib/libllama-common.so", "lib/libmtmd.so", "lib/libllama.so"]
    }
  ]
}
```

`NativeRuntimeReleaseManifest::validate` enforces that every artifact has the
same `mesh_version` as the release manifest. This is the compatibility boundary:
new MeshLLM versions install matching native runtimes rather than reusing older
ones.

The release workflow generates this file as `native-runtimes.json` from native
runtime archives.

## Host Profile

Selection runs against `HostRuntimeProfile`:

```rust
use mesh_llm_native_runtime::{HostRuntimeProfile, NativeRuntimeFlavor};
use std::collections::BTreeSet;

let profile = HostRuntimeProfile {
    os: "linux".to_string(),
    arch: "x86_64".to_string(),
    target_triple: Some("x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu".to_string()),
    available_flavors: BTreeSet::from([
        NativeRuntimeFlavor::Cpu,
        NativeRuntimeFlavor::Cuda,
    ]),
    gpus: Vec::new(),
};
```

`HostRuntimeProfile::current_without_gpu_probe()` only reports CPU plus Metal on
macOS. Production callers that can inspect hardware should build a richer
profile and set `available_flavors` from detected devices.

## Resolution

Use `NativeRuntimeResolver` when the caller needs both the selected artifact and
where it should come from:

```rust
use mesh_llm_native_runtime::{
    NativeRuntimeCache, NativeRuntimeReleaseManifest, NativeRuntimeResolver,
    RuntimeSelection,
};
use std::path::PathBuf;

# fn example(
#     mesh_version: &str,
#     profile: mesh_llm_native_runtime::HostRuntimeProfile,
#     manifest: NativeRuntimeReleaseManifest,
# ) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
let cache = NativeRuntimeCache::new("/tmp/mesh-llm/native-runtimes");
let resolution = NativeRuntimeResolver::new(mesh_version, profile, manifest, cache)
    .with_bundle_dirs(vec![PathBuf::from("./dist/native-runtimes/meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cpu")])
    .resolve(&RuntimeSelection::Recommended)?;

match resolution.source {
    mesh_llm_native_runtime::NativeRuntimeSource::Installed { path } => {
        println!("already installed at {}", path.display());
    }
    mesh_llm_native_runtime::NativeRuntimeSource::Bundle { path } => {
        println!("install from bundled runtime {}", path.display());
    }
    mesh_llm_native_runtime::NativeRuntimeSource::Download { url } => {
        println!("download from {url}");
    }
    mesh_llm_native_runtime::NativeRuntimeSource::Missing => {
        println!("selected runtime has no local source or URL");
    }
}
# Ok(())
# }
```

Use `select_native_runtime` when a caller only needs the best compatible
candidate and does not need source lookup.

Selection modes:

- `RuntimeSelection::Recommended`: choose the highest-ranked compatible runtime.
- `RuntimeSelection::Flavor(NativeRuntimeFlavor::Cuda)`: require a specific
  flavor.
- `RuntimeSelection::Id("meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cuda".to_string())`:
  require a specific artifact ID.

Compatibility checks:

- exact MeshLLM version match
- OS match
- architecture match
- target triple match when both sides declare it
- host support for the artifact flavor
- artifact requirements, such as required GPU name fragments
- explicit flavor or ID selection match

Ranking is `artifact.priority + artifact.flavor.default_rank()`. Default flavor
ranking prefers accelerated runtimes over CPU, with CUDA Blackwell ranked above
general CUDA.

Every candidate is returned in `NativeRuntimeResolution::evaluated` with
structured `CandidateRejection` reasons, so CLIs and diagnostics can explain why
an artifact was skipped.

## Cache Layout

`NativeRuntimeCache` stores installed runtimes under:

```text
<cache-root>/<mesh_version>/<native_runtime_id>/
  manifest.json
  lib/...
```

The default cache root is chosen by callers. The `native_runtime_cache_root`
helper maps a base cache directory to:

```text
<base-cache-dir>/mesh-llm/native-runtimes
```

Important cache operations:

- `installed()`: enumerate installed runtimes.
- `find_installed(mesh_version, native_runtime_id)`: find one runtime.
- `install_from_dir(source_dir)`: copy a packaged runtime directory into the
  versioned cache, replacing any existing runtime with the same ID and version.
- `remove(mesh_version, native_runtime_id)`: delete one runtime.
- `prune(active_mesh_version, NativeRuntimePruneMode::KeepActiveAndPrevious)`:
  keep the active MeshLLM version and the most recent previous version.
- `prune(active_mesh_version, NativeRuntimePruneMode::ActiveOnly)`: remove every
  runtime that does not match the active MeshLLM version.

Install and autoupdate flows should normally prune with `ActiveOnly` after a
successful runtime install for the upgraded MeshLLM version.

## Load Plan Boundary

This crate does not load dynamic libraries itself. It exposes
`InstalledNativeRuntime` as a cache record and
`InstalledNativeRuntime::load_plan()` as the boundary consumed by the Skippy FFI
dynamic loader in the host runtime.

```rust
# fn example(installed: mesh_llm_native_runtime::InstalledNativeRuntime) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
let plan = installed.load_plan()?;
for library in plan.libraries {
    println!("load {}", library.display());
}
# Ok(())
# }
```

`load_plan()` validates that the manifest declares at least one library and that
each declared path exists under the installed runtime directory. The caller
still owns ABI checks and actual dynamic loading.

## CLI Integration

The host runtime crate wraps this API in:

```bash
mesh-llm runtime list --installed
mesh-llm runtime list --available --manifest native-runtimes.json
mesh-llm runtime install
mesh-llm runtime install cuda
mesh-llm runtime remove meshllm-native-runtime-linux-x86_64-cuda
mesh-llm runtime prune --active-only
mesh-llm doctor --json
```

`mesh-llm runtime install` does not require `--manifest` in normal release
usage. It resolves `native-runtimes.json` for the running MeshLLM version from
the release URL, or from `MESH_LLM_NATIVE_RUNTIME_MANIFEST_URL` when that
environment variable is set. `--manifest` and `--bundle-dir` remain available
for CI, offline packages, and local artifact testing. Passing only
`--bundle-dir` does not fetch the default release manifest.

The host runtime's SDK layer owns network downloads, archive extraction,
progress callbacks, checksum verification, and cache installation. This crate
owns the manifest, compatibility, cache, and load-plan semantics those flows
use.

## Rust SDK Integration

Rust SDK consumers use `mesh_llm::sdk::native_runtime` for first-class install
and resolver access:

```rust
use mesh_llm::sdk::native_runtime::{
    NativeRuntimeInstallOptions, RuntimeSelection, install_native_runtime,
};

# async fn example(cache_dir: std::path::PathBuf) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
let outcome = install_native_runtime(NativeRuntimeInstallOptions {
    selection: RuntimeSelection::Recommended,
    cache_dir: Some(cache_dir),
    progress: Some(std::sync::Arc::new(|event| {
        eprintln!(
            "{}: {} bytes",
            event.native_runtime_id,
            event.downloaded_bytes
        );
    })),
    ..Default::default()
})
.await?;

println!("installed {}", outcome.runtime.native_runtime_id);
# Ok(())
# }
```

The SDK module also re-exports the lower-level manifest, resolver, cache, and
load-plan types from this crate for callers that need to query available
runtimes, inspect candidate rejections, remove cached runtimes, or prune older
MeshLLM versions.

## Verification

Release downloads require `sha256` metadata and fail if the archive digest does
not match the release manifest. The SDK exposes
`NativeRuntimeVerificationPolicy::RequireChecksumAndSignature`, but that policy
currently fails closed because signature verification keys and attestation
format are not implemented yet.

## Current Boundaries

- Native runtimes are release artifacts. Cargo does not implicitly build them
  for consumers.
- Runtime versioning is strict: `mesh_version` must match the running MeshLLM
  version.
- The crate preserves unknown flavors so new platform-specific flavor names can
  be added without changing the manifest schema.
- Dynamic loading is intentionally outside this crate; the shipped host runtime
  consumes `load_plan()` and loads the declared libraries through `skippy-ffi`
  when built with `dynamic-native-runtime`.
- Generated runtime crates are not the supported distribution story for native
  runtimes in this PR. The supported path is release artifacts plus
  `native-runtimes.json`.
