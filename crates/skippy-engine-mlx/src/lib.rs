//! MLX (Metal) serving engine for mesh-llm.
//!
//! Serves HF safetensors tensor models over mesh-llm's real OpenAI-compatible
//! frontend (`openai_frontend::OpenAiBackend`), goose-style, on Apple Silicon.
//!
//! All MLX-touching code is gated behind BOTH the `mlx` cargo feature AND
//! `target_os = "macos"`. On any other target, or without the feature, this
//! crate compiles to an empty shell so it never burdens non-Apple builds.
