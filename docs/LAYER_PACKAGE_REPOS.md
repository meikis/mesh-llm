# Contributing Layer Package Repositories

Layer package repositories let Mesh LLM run very large models with Skippy stage
splits. A package repository is a durable Hugging Face repo containing one
`model-package.json` manifest plus GGUF fragments for shared tensors, per-layer
tensors, and optional multimodal projectors.

Use this page for contributor workflow. The exact schema lives in
[specs/layer-package-repos.md](specs/layer-package-repos.md).

## Repository shape

```text
model-package.json
shared/
  metadata.gguf
  embeddings.gguf
  output.gguf
layers/
  layer-00000.gguf
  layer-00001.gguf
  ...
projectors/
  mmproj-model-f16.gguf
README.md
```

Required rules:

- `model-package.json` must be at the repo root.
- `schema_version` must be `1`.
- `format` must be `layer-package`.
- Each manifest artifact path must be relative to the repo root.
- Paths must not be absolute and must not escape with `..`.
- Every artifact entry must include size and SHA-256.
- Production refs should use immutable `hf://namespace/repo@revision` pins.

## Local package tooling

`skippy-model-package` is the local inspection and writing tool. Current
subcommands are:

```bash
skippy-model-package inspect <model.gguf>
skippy-model-package plan <model.gguf> --stages 4
skippy-model-package write <model.gguf> --layers 0..12 --out ./stage-0.gguf
skippy-model-package write-stages <model.gguf> --stages 4 --out-dir ./stages
skippy-model-package write-package <model.gguf> --out-dir ./package
skippy-model-package validate <model.gguf> ./stages/stage-*.gguf
skippy-model-package validate-package <model.gguf> ./package
skippy-model-package preflight ./package --stages 4 --verify-sha256
```

Validate before publishing:

```bash
skippy-model-package validate-package <model.gguf> ./package
skippy-model-package preflight ./package --stages 4 --verify-sha256
```

## Queue a Hugging Face package job

Mesh LLM includes a spend-bearing HF Jobs helper for package generation. It is
dry-run by default and must be confirmed explicitly before submitting jobs:

```bash
mesh-llm models package unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M --dry-run
mesh-llm models package unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M --confirm --follow
mesh-llm models package unsloth/inkling-GGUF:UD-Q2_K_XL --dry-run
mesh-llm models package unsloth/inkling-GGUF:UD-Q2_K_XL --experimental --confirm --follow
```

The hidden compatibility alias is `mesh-llm model-package`; prefer
`mesh-llm models package` in docs and scripts.

Important options:

- `--target <repo>`: destination Hugging Face package repo.
- `--model-id <id>`: OpenAI-facing package model id.
- `--timeout <duration>`: HF Jobs timeout, defaulting to `1h` unless raised by
  size-based estimates.
- `--dry-run`: print the resolved package plan and maximum cost without side effects.
- `--confirm`: submit the job.
- `--follow`: wait and stream job progress.
- `--experimental`: publish the package publicly with an experimental warning
  and tag, and open an unmerged Hugging Face `meshllm/catalog` PR instead of
  committing it to the catalog's `main` revision. Mesh discovery does not see
  the package until that HF PR is reviewed and merged.
- `--status <job-id>`, `--logs <job-id>`, `--cancel <job-id>`, `--list`: inspect
  or manage submitted jobs.
- `--update-script`: refresh the bucket script when needed.

The source model should stay in colon-selector form, for example
`unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M`. A source revision may be requested as
`org/repo@revision:quant`. The job resolves that revision to an immutable commit
SHA before planning and mounts the source model volume at that SHA. Do not split
the quant into a separate `--quant` argument for generated job inputs.

Repository GGUFs whose basenames start with `mmproj` are discovered as
multimodal projector sidecars, not model quants. The job passes them to
`skippy-model-package write-package`, publishes them under `projectors/`, and
preserves the source pipeline tag in the package model card. This is how a
combined vision/audio projector such as Inkling's `mmproj-BF16.gguf` travels
with its Q2 layer package.

## Publishing flow

The HF Jobs script performs the publishing work:

1. clone mesh-llm,
2. build `skippy-model-package`,
3. run `write-package`,
4. validate the manifest,
5. upload package artifacts incrementally,
6. upload `model-package.json`,
7. write a package model card,
8. update `meshllm/catalog`,
9. print the suggested run command.

The printed run command follows this shape:

```bash
mesh-llm serve --model <target-repo> --split
```

For package refs in hand-written docs and configs, prefer the explicit package
scheme:

```text
hf://meshllm/Qwen3-235B-A22B-UD-Q4_K_XL-layers@<revision>
```

## After publishing

Run package-only certification first:

```bash
mesh-llm models certify hf://namespace/repo@revision --package-only --report-out cert.json
```

Use the immutable published ref for certification, not only the local package
directory. Fix package-local preflight diagnostics and published-ref
package-only certification failures before moving on to a live endpoint smoke.

Then run a live endpoint smoke once the mesh is serving it:

```bash
mesh-llm models certify hf://namespace/repo@revision --api-base http://127.0.0.1:9337 --json
```

If the package is intended for public meshes, keep peer artifact transfer off by
default. Enable `MESH_LLM_ARTIFACT_TRANSFER=trusted` only for same-owner or
explicitly trusted-owner deployments, and `open` only in lab environments.
