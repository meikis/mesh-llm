# MLX as a Skippy Stage Engine — Deep Dive and Plan

## Status: exploratory design proposal

This document evaluates using Apple **MLX** (via the Rust `safemlx` / `safemlx-lm`
crates) as an alternative inference engine behind Skippy's staged execution
runtime, and proposes a phased plan.

It combines a read of the current Skippy code (`skippy-ffi`, `skippy-runtime`,
`skippy-server`, `skippy-topology`), a read of the `safemlx` fork
(`../safemlx`), a read of goose's MLX backend (`../goose/crates/goose-local-inference`),
and a second-opinion review from an external model grounded against live
MLX/mlx-lm/safemlx documentation.

**Update — a Phase-2 solo-serving spike has now run on Metal** (`spikes/mlx-solo/`,
branch `micn/mlx-redux`). It confirms the core workflow claim end to end: Qwen3-0.6B
on Apple-Silicon Metal at **321 tok/s** (bf16) and **~604 tok/s** (4-bit), where
**JIT-quantize-on-load matches a pre-quantized artifact** (604 ≈ 603 tok/s) — so
quantizing on load is free at inference time. The goose baseline (source precision)
needs **zero fork patches**; two small `safemlx-lm` fixes are only needed to go
beyond it (JIT quant + loading arbitrary mlx-community repos) and are upstream-PR
candidates. See `spikes/mlx-solo/FINDINGS.md`; results are folded into §5.3,
Phase 2, and §9.

**Update — exact stage-local SafeTensors materialization and dense split
execution are now proven**
(`spikes/mlx-safetensors-stages/`). The SafeTensors index plus per-file headers
are sufficient to map a stage to exact HTTP byte ranges, and Hugging Face honors
those range requests. This materially changes the split artifact conclusion:
nodes do not need published stage packages or even complete source shards. On
Inkling BF16, four layers contain 109.84 GiB of tensors scattered across 942.99
GiB of shard files; exact ranges avoid 833.15 GiB. A SmolLM2-135M proof then
materialized two partial files (layers 0..15 and 15..30), loaded each directly
into MLX, and matched unsplit logits exactly for prefill plus eight decode steps
through Skippy's real F16 and F32 binary activation codec. The remaining
artifact gate is bounded-memory quantization for frontier-sized source tensors.
See `spikes/mlx-safetensors-stages/FINDINGS.md`.

**Update — the first engine-neutral, multi-process stage chain is now proven.**
The new `skippy-engine` crate defines a runtime-neutral `StageEngine` contract;
`skippy-server::engine_transport` carries that contract over the existing
binary stage protocol; and `MlxStageEngine` runs a partial layer range with its
own KV cache. Two real processes, each given only one 155.28 MiB partial
SmolLM2 artifact, reproduced the eight-token whole-model reference exactly over
F16 residuals. Their post-proof RSS was about 189 MiB each. This closes the
dense execution and process-boundary proof. Host topology selection, advanced
cache/session operations, additional families, and bounded-memory quantization
remain. See `crates/skippy-engine-mlx/STAGED_EXECUTION.md`.

## 1. Bottom line

MLX is a **credible second engine** for Skippy, and `safemlx-lm` is a
surprisingly good fit because it implements each model in **pure Rust as an
explicit `embed → layers[..] → norm → lm_head` loop with a per-layer KV cache**.
That is exactly the seam Skippy needs for layer-range stage splitting, and it is
Rust-facing rather than buried in C++.

It is **not** a drop-in replacement for the patched llama.cpp C ABI. The engine
boundary Skippy actually depends on is much larger than "generate tokens": it is
a **staged execution contract** (activation frames in/out, KV page
export/import, layer-range partial load, chunked prefill, single-token decode,
batched verify, trim/checkpoint, tokenizer/chat helpers).

**Two distinct reasons to adopt MLX — keep them separate:**

1. **Workflow / artifact win (biggest near-term value):** MLX loads HF
   **safetensors directly** and can **JIT-quantize on load**, so we can serve
   any supported model at a chosen bit-width *immediately* — no waiting for a
   published GGUF and no pre-run quant pipeline. This is mostly independent of
   the hard split work and pays off first in **solo serving** (§5.3).
2. **Apple-Silicon compute in a chain:** MLX runs straight to Metal and can add
   Apple-Silicon nodes to a staged split — but this is the harder, later payoff,
   gated on partial-load and boundary-fence behaviour.

**Recommendation:** introduce a Rust `StageEngine` trait, keep the existing C ABI
as the `LlamaStageEngine` adapter, and add an Apple-Silicon-gated
`MlxStageEngine`. Do **not** extend the llama.cpp C ABI to host MLX, and do
**not** invent a separate MLX network protocol. For split serving, treat the
immutable upstream SafeTensors checkpoint plus a small quantization profile as
the source of truth; range-fetch, optionally quantize, and cache only the local
stage. Published engine-specific layer packages become an optional prewarmed
optimization rather than a prerequisite. Gate execution behind the remaining
go/no-go work: **bounded-memory stage materialization / partial model loading**
and **per-token boundary fence latency**. The small-model proof also establishes
that a receiver must restore the model compute dtype after decoding the wire
dtype; numeric F32 residual values left as an F32 MLX array change downstream
Metal arithmetic for a BF16 model.

---

## 2. What the Skippy "engine" boundary actually is

Skippy's engine is not a token generator; it is a staged runtime. The contract
lives in `crates/skippy-ffi/src/lib.rs` (raw ABI) and is wrapped safely in
`crates/skippy-runtime/src/lib.rs`. The essential surface a new engine must
satisfy:

**Stage-aware load** (`RuntimeConfig`, `skippy-runtime/src/lib.rs:840`):
- `stage_index`, `layer_start`, `layer_end` — this stage owns a contiguous
  layer range only.
- `include_embeddings`, `include_output` — whether this stage owns the embedding
  table and/or the final norm + lm_head.
- `filter_tensors_on_load` — the intent that a stage should load **only** its
  tensors, not the whole model.
- backend device selection, KV cache dtype, ctx size, batch/ubatch, lanes.

**Activation frame I/O** — the wire contract between stages
(`ActivationFrame` / `ActivationDesc`, `skippy-runtime/src/lib.rs:1046` and
`:1109`):

```
ActivationDesc {
  version, dtype (F32|F16|BF16), layout (TokenMajor|Opaque),
  producer_stage_index, layer_start, layer_end,
  token_count, sequence_count, payload_bytes, flags
}
ActivationFrame { desc, payload: Vec<u8> }
```

- Stage 0 takes token IDs, runs its layers, emits an activation frame.
- Middle stages import a frame, run their layers, emit a new frame.
- Final stage runs last layers + readout, samples, returns the **predicted token
  directly** to stage 0 (generation-3 protocol, see `skippy-server/README.md`).

**Execution calls** (`skippy-runtime/src/lib.rs`):
- `prefill_chunk_frame*` (`:2998`), `decode_step_frame_sampled*` (`:3236`),
  `verify_tokens_frame*` (`:3557`), `copy_output_activation_frame` (`:3652`).
- Sampled variants carry `SamplingConfig` (penalties, logit bias, grammar).

**KV / state movement** (`skippy-runtime/src/lib.rs`):
- `export_kv_page` / `import_kv_page` (`:3866`, `:3956`) with
  `RuntimeKvPageDesc` (`:1114`) — k/v dtype, row bytes, token range, layer range.
- `export_state` / `import_state` (`:3729`), full-state and recurrent-state
  variants, `save_prefix` / `restore_prefix`, `trim_session`, checkpoint/restore.

**Tokenizer / chat / introspection**:
- tokenize/detokenize, EOG check, chat-template apply (incl. JSON tools path),
  chat-response parse, model-info tensor enumeration, GGUF slice writing.

**ABI is versioned and feature-probed** (`skippy-ffi/src/lib.rs:1`): ABI
`0.1.30`, with a feature bitmask (`RUNTIME_SLICE`, `LAYER_PACKAGE`,
`ACTIVATION_FRAME`, `BATCH_VERIFY_FRAME`, `SESSION_CHECKPOINT`,
`NATIVE_MTP_N1`, …). This is the model for how MLX capabilities should be
advertised: **probed, not assumed**.

**Key structural gap:** there is **no Rust `trait`** abstracting this today.
`skippy-server` binds the concrete `StageModel` / `StageSession` FFI structs
directly (`crates/skippy-server/src/frontend.rs:46`, `runtime_state.rs:26`).
Introducing that trait is the enabling refactor for any second engine.

## 3. What MLX / safemlx actually gives us (evidence)

### 3.1 The layer-split seam already exists in `safemlx-lm`

Every model in `../safemlx/safemlx-lm/src/models/*.rs` is a Rust module with the
transformer decomposed into public fields and an explicit forward loop. From
`qwen3.rs`:

```rust
pub struct Qwen3Model {
    pub embed_tokens: MaybeQuantized<nn::Embedding>,
    pub layers: Vec<TransformerBlock>,   // per-layer blocks
    pub norm: nn::RmsNorm,
}
// forward:
let mut h = self.embed_tokens.forward(inputs, stream)?;
for (layer, c) in self.layers.iter_mut().zip(cache.iter_mut()) {
    h = layer.forward(/* x=h, mask, cache=c */, stream)?;
}
self.norm.forward(&h, stream)   // then lm_head at the Model level
```

`pub embed_tokens` / `pub layers` / `pub norm` / `pub lm_head` are exposed across
`qwen3`, `llama`, `gpt_oss`, `gemma4`, `lfm2`, `nemotron_h`, `qwen3_5_moe`, etc.
The per-layer KV cache is a `Vec<Option<C>>` threaded through the loop
(`safemlx-lm/src/lib.rs`, `cache.rs`), and blocks accept an explicit mutable
cache slot. This means running **only** `layers[start..end]` and resuming from an
imported hidden state is mechanically straightforward — no C++ surgery.

### 3.2 Activation observe / intervene hooks

`safemlx-lm/src/inspection.rs` defines `ActivationObserver` with
`observe(name, &Array)` and `intervene(name, &Array) -> Option<Array>` at block
boundaries ([inspection API](https://docs.rs/safemlx-lm/latest/safemlx_lm/inspection/)).
This is useful plumbing/debugging, **but it is not a stage ABI** — it is
name-based and per-tensor. For production we want a first-class
`forward_range()` / `resume_from_hidden()` path, not a reliance on observer
names.

### 3.3 KV cache primitives

`safemlx-lm/src/cache.rs` defines `KeyValueCache` (offset, max_size,
`update_and_fetch`), with `ConcatKeyValueCache`, `SlidingKeyValueCache`,
quantized variants, and `truncate(len)`. Cache state is MLX arrays in unified
memory. This gives us the raw material for export/import/trim — but the state
layout is MLX/model-specific and **not** interchangeable with llama.cpp's ggml
page format.

### 3.4 Loading, quant, and formats

`safemlx-lm` loads Hugging Face-style dirs (`config.json` + `tokenizer.json` +
safetensors) and also **GGUF** (`Array::load_gguf_with_metadata`,
`models/mod.rs:1123`), with a **strict loader** (`weights.rs:155`) that errors on
missing/unused tensors unless explicitly allowed. MLX quant is affine
packed-weight-in-safetensors; there is load-time quantization from unquantized
F32/F16/BF16.

### 3.5 Distributed primitives exist but are unwrapped

`../safemlx/safemlx-sys/src/mlx-c/mlx/c/distributed.h` binds
`all_gather / all_sum / all_min / all_max / send / recv / sum_scatter` and
distributed groups. **The safe `safemlx` layer does not wrap them yet.** This
matters for tensor-parallel within a node, but Skippy's cross-machine model is
its own QUIC activation-frame protocol — we do **not** want to depend on MLX
distributed for the mesh boundary.

### 3.6 goose already ships an MLX backend — what we can reuse

`../goose/crates/goose-local-inference/src/mlx.rs` (1044 lines) uses `safemlx-lm`
(`LoadedModel::load`, `generate`, Gemma4 MTP draft/speculative) as a **single
node** backend behind goose's own `LocalInferenceBackend` trait, feature-gated
`mlx` on macOS. It proves safemlx-lm is production-usable for generation.

**"Right to Metal" is accurate.** goose's MLX path pulls
`safemlx { features = ["accelerate", "metal", "safetensors"] }` and runs on
`Device::new(DeviceType::Gpu, 0)` (`mlx.rs:61,94`) — i.e.
`safemlx-sys → mlx-c → MLX → Metal`, with no llama.cpp/ggml in between. (goose
*also* keeps a separate `llama-cpp-2` Metal path; the two are independent
backends.)

**What is actually reusable, and how:**

| Asset | Reuse verdict |
| --- | --- |
| `safemlx` / `safemlx-lm` crates | **Reuse directly** — this is the real shared dependency. Both goose and Skippy just depend on the published crates. No goose code involved. |
| goose's `mlx.rs` generation flow (prompt build, sampling, MTP draft/verify, streaming, stop tokens, thinking-filter) | **Reuse as a reference template, port not lift.** It is the best worked example of driving safemlx-lm for chat + speculative, but it is coupled to goose types. |
| goose's `LocalInferenceBackend` trait (`backend.rs`, 50 lines) | **Reference only.** It is goose's shape (whole-model `load_model` + `generate`), not Skippy's staged contract. Skippy needs its own `StageEngine` (§6). |
| HF download + shard/registry (`hf_models.rs`, `goose-download-manager`) | **Reference / optional adapter.** `goose-download-manager` is cleanly separable (deps are just `reqwest`/`tokio`), but Skippy already has `model-hf` / `model-artifact`; prefer extending those. |

**Coupling is the reason it is port-not-lift.** goose's `mlx.rs` and `backend.rs`
depend on `goose_provider_types` (`Message`, `MessageContent`, `ProviderError`,
`ProviderUsage`/`Usage`, `DraftStats`), `rmcp::model::Tool`/`Role`, and
`local_model_registry::ModelSettings`. Skippy speaks `ActivationFrame`, token
IDs, `SamplingConfig`, and its OpenAI frontend types instead. So the *algorithms*
(how to prefill, sample, run MTP draft/verify against safemlx-lm) transfer
directly; the *types and trait* do not.

**License:** goose is **Apache-2.0**, so porting code with attribution is fine.

**Bottom line:** the highest-leverage reuse is simply **sharing the `safemlx-lm`
crate** (and coordinating on/​contributing the stage-aware `forward_range` /
partial-load additions the fork needs — see Phase 3), plus using goose's `mlx.rs`
as the reference implementation for the single-stage generation path in Phase 2.
It is whole-model and single-stage, so it is not a template for the staged/
KV-page work.

## 4. Fit analysis and sharp edges

The happy path fits:

```
tokens or imported hidden state
  → optional embedding (stage 0 only)
  → layers[start..end] with per-layer cache
  → hidden state frame  (middle/non-final)
  or → final norm + lm_head → sample → token  (final)
```

Sharp edges, in rough priority order:

1. **Partial execution must mean partial loading.** Building a whole
   `LoadedModel` and skipping layers can still materialize all weights. Skippy's
   entire value proposition is fitting a big model across small machines, so a
   stage must load only its layer range (plus embeddings/readout when it owns
   them). This requires a **stage-aware loader** in `safemlx-lm` that
   instantiates `layers` for `[start..end]` and only reads matching safetensors
   shards. **This is the #1 go/no-go item.**

2. **Every model family must define its exact residual-stream boundary.**
   Embedding scale, final norm, tied vs untied output, RoPE position accounting
   across a stage cut, attention mask construction, and any per-layer-type
   sideband cannot be inferred generically. Each family is a separate
   certification (mirrors `skippy-topology` family capability records,
   `crates/skippy-topology/src/lib.rs:182`).

3. **Hybrid / recurrent models need more than hidden states.** Mamba/RWKV/gated
   DeltaNet-style layers (`nemotron_h`, `qwen3_5_moe` / `qwen3_next`, `lfm2` in
   safemlx-lm) carry recurrent state, not page-addressable KV. Skippy already
   has `export_recurrent_state`; MLX would need the analogous opaque sideband,
   or those families are restricted to non-split.

4. **The MLX model matrix ≠ the safemlx-lm matrix ≠ the Skippy-certified
   matrix.** safemlx-lm implements models individually and is young. Start with
   **dense Llama / Qwen**; do not promise arbitrary model coverage.

5. **The boundary is more than execution.** Sampling, batched verify, trim,
   checkpoint, tokenizer/chat, and state movement are all in the ABI today
   (`crates/skippy-ffi/README.md`). The trait must cover them (some can be
   engine-agnostic and moved above the engine).

---

## 5. Hard problems (with concrete approaches)

### 5.1 Lazy evaluation — the network boundary is an eval boundary

MLX is lazy and uses unified memory. A stage boundary forces materialization.
The per-token non-final-stage sequence must be:

1. Run local layer range (lazy).
2. Cast to negotiated wire dtype (`ActivationDType::F16` first).
3. Make contiguous + token-major (`ActivationLayout::TokenMajor`).
4. **Evaluate the outgoing array AND all updated cache arrays together.**
5. Get a host-readable slice, serialize into `ActivationFrame.payload`, send.

In `safemlx`: `Array::evaluated()` materializes and `EvaluatedArray::as_slice()`
gives host access (host access / save also forces eval)
([safemlx lazy-eval source](https://docs.rs/safemlx/latest/src/safemlx/lib.rs.html),
[MLX lazy-evaluation guide](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/usage/lazy_evaluation.html)).

Critical details:
- **Evaluate cache state even when it does not feed the outgoing hidden state**,
  or lazy cache graphs grow unbounded across decode steps.
- Unified memory removes the explicit GPU→CPU copy but **not** GPU completion,
  sync, layout conversion, or the QUIC copy.
- Final stage: evaluate the sampled token + cache; never materialize a
  hidden-state frame.
- Evaluate params once at warmup.
- Consider separate **compiled** paths for fixed-shape decode vs bucketed
  prefill (`safemlx` [`compile_with_state`](https://docs.rs/safemlx/latest/safemlx/transforms/compile/)),
  watching recompilation from shape changes.

**The benchmark that matters** is not MLX layer time; it is
`last layer → cast/contiguous → eval fence → host view → QUIC write`, per token,
at realistic hidden widths. **This is go/no-go item #2.**

### 5.2 KV cache export/import/trim

MLX cache arrays make movement possible, but mlx-lm/safemlx cache state is not
llama.cpp page-shaped (mlx-lm caches expose array state, metadata, and tail
trimming, and prompt caches serialize as safetensors —
[mlx-lm cache.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/main/mlx_lm/models/cache.py)).
Do **not** reuse `RuntimeKvPageDesc` for MLX; keep that in the llama adapter.
Define an engine-general **cache codec** with a versioned descriptor:

```
engine + model digest, architecture revision
layer range, token range + absolute position
cache kind (concat | sliding/rotating | quantized | recurrent)
segments: { role, layer, dtype, shape, strides/layout, payload }
cache-specific metadata (rotating offset, quant scales/biases)
```

- Export: slice token range, order rotating caches temporally, contiguous,
  evaluate, serialize.
- Import: validate engine/model/range/layout, rebuild arrays, restore offsets.
- Trim: offset change is cheap; reclaiming/compacting memory needs slicing.
- **Quantized KV** needs packed values + scales/biases, not just row sizes.
- **Do not promise KV interop between llama.cpp and MLX.** Import requires same
  engine + model digest + quant + arch revision + cache policy.

### 5.3 Artifact strategy: JIT safetensors vs pre-quantized layer packages

This is arguably the **strongest first reason to adopt MLX**, and it is largely
independent of the hard split work. The benefit is really **two separate
things**, and they behave very differently for solo vs split serving:

- **(A) Source freedom** — load HF **safetensors** directly instead of waiting
  for someone to publish a GGUF (or running our own GGUF quant pipeline first).
- **(B) JIT quantization** — quantize at load time (`with_quantization(Q4/…)`)
  instead of ahead of time.

(A) applies equally to solo and splits (it's just "which file do we load").
(B) is where solo and splits diverge sharply.

**What safemlx-lm actually supports (confirmed):**
- `ModelLoadOptions::with_quantization(...)` quantizes eligible dense weights
  **one tensor at a time** on load; checkpoints already carrying matching quant
  metadata load directly without requantizing
  (`../safemlx/safemlx-lm/src/models/mod.rs:137`).
- Sharded safetensors are understood via `model.safetensors.index.json`'s
  `weight_map` (tensor name → shard file), so the loader knows which shard holds
  `model.layers.<n>.*` (`../safemlx/safemlx-lm/src/weights.rs:463`). MLX quant is
  affine packed-weights-in-safetensors, matching mlx-lm's converter
  ([mlx-lm quantized loading/conversion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/main/mlx_lm/utils.py)).

#### Solo serving → pure win, lands first

Download BF16/FP16 safetensors → `with_quantization(Q4)` → serve. No wait for a
published GGUF, no pre-run of the quant pipeline. Any dense model safemlx-lm
supports is instantly servable at a chosen bit-width. **goose already does
exactly this** single-node (`../goose/crates/goose-local-inference/src/mlx.rs`).
Near-zero new distributed work; this is the cheapest, highest-value first step.

#### Splits → works, but with four real conditions

The premise of a split is that *no node holds the whole model*, which stresses
JIT quant:

1. **Stage-aware partial load + quant.** Today safemlx-lm builds
   `0..num_hidden_layers` and the strict loader expects all params, so JIT quant
   is a *whole-model* op. A split node must instantiate only `layers[start..end]`,
   read only the shards overlapping its range, and quantize only those tensors.
   This is exactly go/no-go **Spike 1**, now with a quant step folded in.
2. **Exact tensor-range download (proven).** The `weight_map` selects source
   files, and each SafeTensors header supplies exact tensor byte offsets. HTTP
   range requests therefore avoid whole-shard overfetch. This is a modest win
   for layer-ordered Qwen/Nemotron/GLM checkpoints and a requirement for
   Inkling, whose tensors for four layers are spread across 57 BF16 files.
3. **Deterministic cross-stage quant.** Every stage must quantize *identically*
   (same algo / group-size / bits / tie handling) or the split model drifts
   numerically from the solo model. Affine quant is deterministic given its
   params, so this is achievable — but the params must be pinned and folded into
   family/topology certification.
4. **Cache the quantized slice.** Re-quantizing on every launch/replan across N
   nodes is wasteful. Skippy's identity-bound materialized cache
   (`crates/skippy-runtime/src/package/materialized_cache.rs`, keyed by
   `model_id / topology_id / stage_id / layer_start / layer_end`) is the natural
   home: first launch pays the JIT cost → materialize a per-stage quantized
   artifact → reuse thereafter.

#### The tension worth naming

Skippy's existing chain (`skippy-quantize`, layer-package repos, BF16→GGUF) is
built around **pre-quantized, exactly-sliced GGUF parts** so split nodes never
quantize at runtime. Exact SafeTensors byte ranges remove the earlier coarser-
slicing disadvantage. The remaining trade is cold-start quantization time and
temporary source precision versus a prewarmed, published quant. The two paths
should **coexist**:

- **JIT safetensors = flexible coverage path** — range-fetch only the stage,
  adapt its precision to available hardware, cache the deterministic result,
  and require no weight-republishing step.
- **Pre-quantized layer packages = optimized path** — for models served
  seriously (exact slices, no runtime quant, tailored partial download).

#### One artifact identity, two physical encodings

Use **one logical package identity, not one physical weight encoding**:

```
model identity + source revision + tokenizer/config/chat metadata + topology
variants:
  llama-gguf: GGUF parts + quant          (existing skippy-model-package path)
  mlx-jit:    HF tensor ranges + per-stage quant profile (quantize on load; cache)
  mlx-packaged: pre-quantized MLX stage shards + index (optimized split path)
```

- Make **BF16/FP16 HF safetensors the canonical source**; derive all variants
  reproducibly (this repo already has `skippy-quantize`, `model-hf`,
  `model-package`, and BF16 GGUF conversion skills).
- **Never** transcode an already-quantized GGUF → MLX quant (dequant/requant
  loses quality and still rebuilds arch metadata).
- Nodes download only their selected engine/stage variant, so catalog
  duplication need not become per-node duplication.
- For true partial download in the packaged path, stage-specific MLX
  safetensors shard/index generation is needed (parallel to today's GGUF slice
  writing).

### 5.4 Cross-machine execution

Treat **MLX as the local compute engine and Skippy as the distributed runtime.**
mlx-lm's `pipeline()` / `sharded_load()` / `send`/`recv` + `all_gather` is useful
**reference**, but it uses static ranks and MLX collectives — it is not Skippy's
QUIC activation-frame protocol with independent stage lifecycle, capability
negotiation, and direct final-token return. Keep Skippy's transport; use MLX only
for compute
([MLX distributed docs](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/usage/distributed.html),
[mlx-lm utils](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/main/mlx_lm/utils.py),
[pipeline mixin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/main/mlx_lm/models/pipeline.py)).

For normal Ethernet/Wi-Fi: an 8192-wide F16 activation is ~16 KiB/token/boundary
(decode is latency-bound, not bandwidth-bound); prefill 512×8192×F16 is ~8
MiB/boundary (bandwidth matters). Pipeline parallelism does **not** speed up
single-sequence decode — only concurrent sessions / speculative spans keep stages
busy. Skippy's topology wire sizing (`crates/skippy-topology/src/lib.rs:1415`)
already models F16 = `2 × hidden_width`.

### 5.5 Platform and dependency footprint

"To the metal like goose" and "lean dep" are both achievable, but the second has
a real catch: **MLX is lean at runtime and heavy at build time.**

**Runtime footprint — genuinely lean.** goose's path is
`safemlx → safemlx-sys → mlx-c → MLX → Metal`, statically linked
(`safemlx-sys/build.rs` sets `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`), running on
`Device::new(DeviceType::Gpu, 0)`. The vendored `mlx-c` is a ~1 MB C shim; there
is no runtime service or subprocess. Mesh can depend on the same crates for the
identical to-the-metal path — the metal-ness lives in `safemlx-sys`, nothing
goose-specific.

**Build footprint — a second heavy native lane.** `safemlx-sys/build.rs` drives
**CMake**, and the bundled `CMakeLists.txt` uses `FetchContent` to **git-clone
the full MLX C++ core from `github.com/ml-explore/mlx.git` and compile it**.
Building therefore needs CMake ≥3.25, a C++20 compiler, network to fetch MLX,
and — for Metal — Apple's `metal` shader compiler (`xcrun -find metal`, producing
`mlx.metallib`). This sits alongside the existing llama.cpp patch-queue build and
becomes another native runtime artifact under the
`MESH_LLM_DYNAMIC_NATIVE_RUNTIME` packaging model.

**Keeping it lean = isolation, not intrinsic lightness.** Put the engine in its
own crate (`skippy-engine-mlx`) gated by **both** a cargo `feature = "mlx"`
**and** `cfg(target)` (Apple Silicon, optionally Linux/CUDA). Then default,
Linux-ROCm, Vulkan, and Windows builds never pull MLX or run its CMake — exactly
how goose gates it. Lean by construction, for the platforms that don't use it.

**Support matrix — broader than macOS, but not the full llama.cpp matrix**
(from `safemlx-sys/build.rs` + `safemlx-sys/README.md`):

| Target | MLX support |
| --- | --- |
| macOS Apple Silicon | ✅ Metal + Accelerate |
| iOS / tvOS / visionOS | ✅ Metal |
| Linux x86_64 / aarch64 | ✅ CPU |
| Linux + NVIDIA | ✅ CUDA (the `cuda`/`nccl` features **panic** on non-Linux) |
| Linux + AMD (ROCm) | ⏳ not today — large **active but unmerged** upstream experiment (see below) |
| Vulkan (any) | ❌ upstream *wishlist* only, no implementation |
| Windows | ❌ (some `if(WIN32)` scaffolding in vendored `mlx-c`, no working backend) |

**Coverage is expanding, and safemlx tracks it fast.** `jbg/safemlx` is very
active (103 commits, latest 2026-07-15) and pins a recent MLX core (`v0.32.0`).
It wires in new backends quickly: the `Add CUDA support` commit landed a full
`build.rs` + CMake patch + Linux CI + `cuda.rs` module + smoke test in one go,
and there is `if(WIN32)` DLL-export scaffolding in the vendored `mlx-c`. So the
matrix above is a **snapshot, not a ceiling**.

**The gaps are gated by MLX upstream, and there are *two* gates.** safemlx does
not build backends of its own — every one of its non-`main` branches is model /
runtime / quant work, not hardware work, and `forks_count`/`network_count` are 0
with no open PRs. A new backend must therefore (1) land in `ml-explore/mlx`
(C++), and only then (2) be wired through safemlx — exactly the sequence CUDA
followed (`Add CUDA support` was safemlx *exposing* an upstream backend, not
authoring one). So hardware coverage tracks upstream MLX, delayed by the safemlx
wiring step.

**ROCm is real but not bankable yet.** Upstream MLX has a large, active AMD/ROCm
effort — PR **#2300 "[Experiment] ROCm backend"** (≈449 commits, +45k lines, open
~13 months, updated as of this writing) plus issue **#2556 "Add ROCm Support for
AMD GPUs"**. It is **unmerged and `mergeable_state: dirty`**, so it is genuine
momentum, not a shipped backend. Vulkan is only an upstream *wishlist* issue with
no implementation; Windows has scaffolding but no backend. Net: the matrix is
**expanding (CPU → Metal → CUDA, ROCm being actively attempted upstream)**, so
treat it as a moving target — but do not plan around ROCm/Vulkan/Windows until
they both merge upstream **and** appear in safemlx.

**Strategic consequence.** **Today**, the ROCm / Vulkan / Windows gaps mean
**MLX cannot be Skippy's sole engine** — which reinforces (not changes) the plan:
MLX is an **additive, feature+cfg-gated second engine**, strongest on Apple
Silicon (with Linux/CUDA a real second target, and AMD plausibly later), while
llama.cpp stays the cross-platform default. Crucially, even in the optimistic
world where MLX gains ROCm/Vulkan, the durable reason to keep llama.cpp is **not**
platform coverage but its **GGUF/imatrix k-quant maturity** and the existing
**patch-queue investment** — those are the sticky arguments; hardware coverage is
the reversible one.

## 6. Recommended architecture

**Option (a): a second implementation behind a Rust `StageEngine` trait.**

```
Skippy protocol / skippy-server
    └── StageEngine (new trait, engine-agnostic descriptors + byte buffers)
          ├── LlamaStageEngine → existing skippy-ffi C ABI  (unchanged)
          └── MlxStageEngine   → safemlx / safemlx-lm        (Apple-Silicon-gated)
```

Trait covers: capability discovery + model inspection; stage-aware open/load;
session lifecycle; prefill / decode / batched verify; activation import/export;
trim / checkpoint / reset; opaque-or-segmented state export/import; final-stage
logits/sampling; tokenizer/chat (where not yet lifted above the engine). Backend
arrays and native handles stay private; the trait exchanges **Skippy-owned
descriptors and `Vec<u8>` payloads**.

Rejected alternatives:
- **Extend the llama.cpp C ABI for MLX** — no. It embeds GGUF/ggml dtype and
  llama loading concepts; MLX is already Rust-facing. This would degrade a good
  native adapter into a lowest-common-denominator API.
- **Separate MLX server protocol** — no, initially. It duplicates lifecycle,
  networking, and compatibility. If Metal/MLX crash isolation later becomes
  necessary, add an **optional subprocess** implementation behind the *same*
  `StageEngine` trait, reusing the existing Skippy stage protocol — not a new
  public surface.

Crate shape (fits the repo's semantic-ownership rules):
- `skippy-engine` (new): the `StageEngine` trait + shared descriptors
  (activation frame, cache codec, capability probe). Engine-neutral.
- `skippy-runtime` becomes / provides `LlamaStageEngine` implementing the trait.
- `skippy-engine-mlx` (new, `cfg(all(target_os="macos", target_arch="aarch64"))`,
  feature `mlx`): `MlxStageEngine` over `safemlx`/`safemlx-lm`.
- `skippy-server` depends on `dyn StageEngine`, not concrete `StageModel`.

Protocol compatibility: MLX support is **additive** — a new engine capability
advertised via the existing feature-probe + gossip capability mechanism, with
llama.cpp remaining the default. No gossip/stream/ABI break. A mixed-engine chain
(llama stage ↔ MLX stage) must be a **separately certified** capability with
verified residual boundary, RoPE convention, activation dtype, and model
revision — default to **engine-homogeneous chains** first.

---

## 7. Phased plan

**Phase 0 — Spikes (go/no-go, no product wiring).** Standalone binaries in
`../safemlx` or a throwaway crate. See §8. Nothing merges to Skippy until Spike 1
(partial load) and Spike 2 (boundary fence) pass.

**Phase 1 — Introduce `StageEngine` trait (llama only).** Pure refactor: define
the trait in a new `skippy-engine` crate, implement it for the existing
`skippy-runtime` FFI, and switch `skippy-server` to `dyn StageEngine`. No
behavior change; ship this independently of MLX. Validate with existing
`skippy-correctness` and `mic-lab` runs.

> **Partially implemented on this branch.** The engine-neutral crate, an
> additive reduced binary server lane, and a dense `LlamaStageEngine` adapter
> over the existing `RuntimeState` now exist; MLX uses the same contract for the
> two-process proof. The mature llama server has not yet been switched from its
> concrete `RuntimeState` path because its broader batching, cache, MTP, and
> multimodal surface still needs capability-aware migration.

**Phase 2 — Solo MLX serving + JIT quant (the workflow win; lead here).**
`MlxStageEngine` as a single-stage/whole-model engine: open/load, session,
prefill, decode-sampled, tokenizer/chat, final-stage sampling — plus the
**source-freedom + JIT-quant** path (§5.3): download HF safetensors, quantize on
load at a chosen bit-width, serve. Port goose's `mlx.rs` generation flow (§3.6)
rather than lifting it. Wire behind `--serving-backend mlx` (parallel to the
existing skippy backend selector in `docs/SKIPPY.md`). Validate against
`skippy-correctness` vs llama.cpp logits for the same model. This delivers the
"serve any supported model instantly, no wait for quant" benefit with minimal
new distributed work, and de-risks the engine before any split work.

> **Spike done on Metal (`spikes/mlx-solo/`).** The load→generate half is proven:
> Qwen3-0.6B from raw HF safetensors, in Rust, on Apple-Silicon Metal, matching
> goose's setup exactly (`["accelerate","metal","safetensors"]`, `Device::Gpu`).
> Measured decode: **321 tok/s** source precision (bf16), **~604 tok/s** at 4-bit —
> and crucially **JIT-quantize-on-load (604) ≈ a pre-quantized mlx-community repo
> (603)**, so quantizing on load is free at inference time. The source-precision
> path (goose's baseline) needs **zero fork patches**; two small `safemlx-lm` fixes
> are only needed to go beyond it (JIT quant of a tied-embedding checkpoint, and
> loading published quant repos that omit the `mode` field) — both upstream-PR
> candidates, not mesh-llm drift (see §9). CPU is not a serving path and was not
> benchmarked as one.

**Phase 3 — Streaming stage materialization + partial load + activation
frames.** Convert the proven tensor-range plan into a bounded-memory pipeline:
range-fetch one tensor, optionally quantize it, append it to a derived stage
cache, and release the source buffer. Add `forward_range` /
`resume_from_hidden` and a stage-aware model constructor to `safemlx-lm`.
Implement `prefill_chunk_frame` / `decode_step_frame` /
`copy_output_activation_frame` producing Skippy `ActivationFrame`s. Two-stage
single-machine parity first, then two Macs over the real network.

> **Dense single-machine spike passed.** SmolLM2-135M was split 15+15 using two
> exact-range partial SafeTensors artifacts. F16 and F32 `StageWireMessage`
> boundaries both matched unsplit MLX with zero measured logit delta across
> prompt prefill and eight decode steps. This proves the basic artifact and
> activation seams, but not bounded-memory quantization or server integration.

**Phase 4 — KV/state codec + verify + trim/checkpoint.** Implement the
engine-general cache codec (§5.2), `verify_tokens_frame` for speculative decode,
trim/checkpoint/reset. Add speculative (safemlx-lm already has Gemma4 MTP draft
as a reference).

**Phase 5 — Artifact/packaging + certification.** MLX variant in the model
package (§5.3), stage-shard partial download, per-family/quant certification into
`skippy-topology` capability records and `docs/skippy/` family docs. Mixed-engine
chain certification only if warranted.

**Phase 6 — Promotion.** Only after correctness + performance parity on the
Apple-Silicon target does MLX become a default-selectable engine for
Apple-Silicon nodes. llama.cpp remains the cross-platform default.

## 8. Spike gates (go/no-go before Phase 3)

1. **Partial-loading proof (DENSE GO, QUANT PARTIAL):** remote exact-range
   selection is proven, including on 1.9 TB Inkling BF16. SmolLM2 partial files
   were materialized and loaded without a complete checkpoint. Still required:
   confirm peak RSS is bounded by quantized stage + one source tensor and
   scratch during tensor-at-a-time load-time quantization.
2. **Boundary latency breakdown (GO/NO-GO):** measure layer compute, cast,
   contiguous, **eval fence**, host readback, serialize, and receive-reconstruct
   **independently**, at hidden widths 4096/8192/16384 and token counts
   1/32/512. Decode is single-sequence latency-bound; prove the fence doesn't
   dominate.
3. **Two-stage dense parity (INITIAL GO):** SmolLM2/Llama at split 15 passed F32
   and F16 through the real binary codec with zero measured logit delta for one
   prefill plus eight decode steps. Still required: multiple split points,
   chunked prefill, 128-token decode, two processes, and cross-engine comparison.
4. **Real network run:** two Macs over Wi-Fi and 1/10GbE (Thunderbolt if
   relevant); report end-to-end tok/s + p50/p95 inter-token latency, not local
   MLX throughput.
5. **KV round-trip:** export/import multiple token pages, resume decode, compare
   logits; test trim + speculative rejection; include rotating + quantized cache.
6. **Concurrency:** multiple sessions, cancellation, repeated resets; verify
   MLX stream/array ownership under the chosen Tokio / dedicated-thread model.
7. **Compilation stability:** separate fixed-shape decode vs bucketed prefill;
   watch recompilation counts, observer overhead, long-run graph/memory growth.

Spikes 1 and 2 are more decisive than any standalone token/s benchmark.

## 9. Risks and unknowns

- **JIT quant is free at inference time on Metal (confirmed by spike), but CPU is
  not a serving path.** On Apple-Silicon Metal, JIT 4-bit (604 tok/s) matched a
  pre-quantized mlx-community repo (603 tok/s), and source precision ran at 321
  tok/s — so the §5.3 "serve any model instantly, JIT-quantized" claim holds with
  no runtime penalty. MLX quant matmul is Metal-optimized with no fast CPU kernel,
  so JIT quant must be gated behind a Metal (or CUDA) backend; do not expose a CPU
  quant serving path. (This supersedes an earlier CPU-only measurement.)
- **Partial load may require nontrivial changes to `safemlx-lm`** (loader + model
  constructors currently build `0..num_hidden_layers`). Upstreaming to the fork
  is likely necessary. (Highest risk for the split work.)
- **Eval-fence latency** could erode the benefit of adding Apple-Silicon compute
  to a chain, especially over Wi-Fi.
- **Model coverage churn — confirmed by spike:** safemlx-lm is young; each family
  is bespoke Rust and separately certified. The spike hit two papercuts on
  Qwen3-0.6B alone: (1) the published crate hard-enables the `metal` feature, so
  a Metal-less/CI build needs a **workspace-level** `default-features = false`;
  (2) tied-embedding `lm_head.weight` fails the *quantized* strict loader
  (dense load tolerates it). Both fixed in the fork; expect more per-family.
- **Recurrent/hybrid + MoE** splitting is materially harder than dense; scope
  them out of early phases.
- **Two artifact pipelines** add storage + certification cost; mitigate with a
  single canonical BF16 source and reproducible derivation.
- **safemlx supply chain — pin to a git rev, not a crates.io version (confirmed
  this session).** The published crates collide version strings with the fork
  HEAD: crates.io `safemlx-lm 0.4.1` is a *different, older* codebase than the
  fork's `0.4.1` (851 vs 2221 lines in `qwen3.rs`), because the fork develops on
  a fixed version without bumping. A fork-free build against published crates
  **compiled and ran but produced gibberish for Qwen3 source precision and
  crashed on a pre-quantized repo** (`rms_norm` size mismatch) — the working
  dense-Qwen3/Llama + JIT-quant code exists only in unpublished fork HEAD. So
  MLX-for-Skippy must **pin a specific git commit** of `jbg/safemlx` (and carry
  the small loader fixes until upstreamed), or coordinate a real published
  release. This makes "track upstream + pin + possibly patch" a **standing cost**,
  not a one-off.
- **Hardware coverage is a moving target with two gates.** New backends must land
  in upstream `ml-explore/mlx` *then* be wired through safemlx (which authors no
  backends itself). ROCm is an active-but-unmerged upstream experiment (#2300);
  Vulkan is wishlist-only; Windows has scaffolding but no backend. Do not plan
  around AMD/Vulkan/Windows until both gates clear.
- **Compat discipline:** MLX must stay additive (feature-probe + gossip
  capability); homogeneous chains by default; mixed-engine only when certified.

## 10. Immediate next steps

1. Add tensor-at-a-time MLX quantization to the materializer and measure peak
   RSS against the one-source-tensor memory contract.
2. Route normal `skippy-server` launch through the engine-neutral contract while
   retaining capability-gated llama-only batching/cache/MTP/multimodal paths;
   the dense llama adapter and MLX two-process binary-wire proof are complete.
3. Run **Spike 2 (boundary fence)** at frontier residual widths and keep it as a
   go/no-go gate.
4. Use Nemotron-H as the first frontier-family follow-up already represented in
   `safemlx-lm`; then port Inkling text from the upstream Transformers reference.
