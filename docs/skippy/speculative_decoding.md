# Speculative Decoding Outstanding Work

This note tracks open work for n-gram speculative decoding and SPD sidecar
serving. Broader staged-serving design lives in [`../SKIPPY.md`](../SKIPPY.md),
and benchmark command/report guidance lives in
[`../../crates/skippy-bench/README.md`](../../crates/skippy-bench/README.md).

## Current State

### N-Gram

N-gram speculative decoding is implemented and useful, especially for repeated
coding/editing sessions. It is model-free: the pool observes accepted target
tokens, proposes continuations when a context suffix repeats, and the staged
target verifies every proposed token through `VerifySpan`.

Current policy:

- Use n-gram speculation for coding-shaped sessions and repeated edit loops.
- Do not expect large wins on cold, one-shot, open-ended chat.
- Keep the default n-gram confidence policy flat at 55% until the verifier path
  is redesigned around actual verifier cost.
- Treat n-gram pooling as independent from KV/full-state cache. It remains safe
  for recurrent families such as Qwen3.6 because it does not restore model
  state.

### SPD Sidecar

Status as of 2026-06-19: SPD is a real native request-path proof, but not a
speedup proof yet.

For the current `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` product target, use the exact two-stage
`23,36` topology observed through Mesh and keep the sidecar tied to that split.
The immediate blocker is now sidecar quality on the native Q4 serving
distribution, not ordinary worker orchestration. The first HF-scale
topology-correct sidecar trained on UltraChat `train_sft` with `15997` usable
rows, BF16, `max_length=2048`, `epochs=1`, LR `1e-4`, `num_spec_layers=4`, and
draft top-k `4`. Reference held-out eval on `96` prompts / `6123` generated
tokens reported aggregate acceptance `0.7013`, equivalent accept length
`1.4026`, and theoretical gain `41.0%`; serving export and Rust/Python fixture
parity passed.

That reference score did not transfer into enough native Q4 top-1 acceptance
for pipeline-fill economics. Strict live-tap parity against the HF BF16 fixture fails because the
native package hidden states differ from HF BF16 rows, but the request path is
mechanically clean: required taps are present, verifier greedy output matches
baseline, local package-backed rolling OpenAI smoke matches content on
`6 / 6` prompts with `0` tap failures and accepts `17 / 90` proposals, and the
real two-stage worker smoke matches content on `6 / 6` prompts with `0` tap
failures and accepts `16 / 89` proposals. Treat this as end-to-end SPD
mechanics evidence for the real split, not a speed claim. It keeps the work
aligned with the SPD paper: speed requires speculation to be hidden under the
target pipeline step, and theoretical `L'_acc = N/K*n` must remain separate
from measured wall-clock speed. The next gate is a robust same-topology sidecar
whose native package-backed serving clears `paper_pipeline_estimate > 1.0` with
margin on held-out prompts.

A physical split is not required to decide whether a newly trained SPD sidecar
predicts useful tokens. The quality ladder is reference/HF held-out acceptance,
Rust fixture parity for the exported sidecar, local live-tap parity on the
logical split, and local package-backed baseline-versus-SPD smoke with nonzero
accepted proposals and saved candidate token round trips. The real two-node
worker run then validates distributed transport, endpoint placement, per-stage
KV cleanup, and timing under actual node latency.

The pre-LAN gate should now be explicit and repeatable, not trial-and-error.
Hugging Face can run the expensive single-machine qualification loop: raw
product-tap/native-Q4 capture, raw-mode sidecar training, held-out scoring,
serving export, and package-backed `spd-openai-smoke`. The current
`native-package-fresh` lane exports a serving-only fixture for row metadata and
final norm; it does not yet produce a true Python/reference parity fixture, so
do not claim Rust/Python fixture parity for that lane. After smoke,
`evals/spd/simulate_latency.py --openai-report ...` converts the observed
accepted/proposed candidate-token round trips into a latency sweep over assumed
physical stage costs and LAN hops. This is how we decide whether a real split
is plausible before spending M4/mini time. It is still not a measured
distributed speedup claim.

For Qwen3-Coder-480B S8, the dry-run planner now resolves the exact
`meshllm/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-UD-Q4_K_XL-layers` package as `62`
layers / width `6144`, uses vocab size `151936`, emits S8 taps
`[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62]`, and plans `rtx-pro-6000x4` for `4.5h` at max
`$49.49991`. The native command graph avoids `AutoModelForCausalLM`,
`hf_train_eval_qwen06.py`, `spd-live-tap-parity`, and warm-start artifacts.
After job `meshllm/6a3535603093dba73ce2a264`, the dry run now also verifies
that `spd-product-corpus-capture` emits
`--product-native-teacher-logits true` and that generated HF setup does not ask
pip to upgrade/install `torch` over the PyTorch CUDA base image. The first
serious spend-bearing run was HF Job
`meshllm/6a3535603093dba73ce2a264` with `rtx-pro-6000x4` / `4.5h` under the
timeout cap. It bootstrapped from uploaded artifacts under
`meshllm/skippy-spd-qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-ud-q4-k-xl-s8`, because the local
branch was not pushed from this machine. The artifact was
`job-inputs/20260619T122507Z-b843a851/`, upload commit
`80014e284aa1e727a305c3ff5c44fb2ca82659d6`, with patch SHA256
`7ec74581ee16e30ce4d56b99a5b0092eb8fc513b92c36acae8fbf8a93d952436`.
Earlier startup attempts failed before model work due to HF CLI command parsing,
an unexported bootstrap variable, and a missing generated-plan output
directory; CPU canary `meshllm/6a3531e9953ed90bfb9446e4` verified the corrected
CLI form. Job `meshllm/6a353427953ed90bfb944722` reached generated setup and
failed at `just build-runtime backend=cuda cuda_arch="$CUDA_ARCH"`; the planner
now emits the recipe's positional form, `just build-runtime cuda "$CUDA_ARCH"`.
Job `meshllm/6a3535603093dba73ce2a264` passed that failure, built the CUDA
stage runtime, built release `skippy-bench`/`skippy-server`, downloaded the full
Qwen480 package snapshot (`69` files, about `276G`), and generated disjoint
UltraChat prompt-token shards (`512` train prompts, `64` held-out prompts). It
then failed at the first capture invocation because
`--product-native-teacher-logits` was emitted without the required `true` value.
Resubmitted HF Job `meshllm/6a353b9d3093dba73ce2a2bf` used the fixed artifact
`job-inputs/20260619T125208Z-22663dd2/`, pinned to upload commit
`da3c7956783e86c3e50368ddbd32c00286f263df`. It ran for `1249` seconds, costing
about `$3.82`, and reached actual `capture[0]` startup with the fixed
`--product-native-teacher-logits true` command. It passed CUDA/Rust release
builds, package download, and prompt-token generation, then failed because
topology-only package stage `55..62` could not allocate a `30905.58 MiB` CUDA3
model buffer. The two serious Qwen480 jobs cost about `$7.45` combined; adding
the shorter startup failures keeps this lane under about `$8`. No run has
captured rows, trained, exported, or smoked yet. Treat the next step as a
live-runner memory-residency fix, not another blind resubmission and not a
distributed speedup run.

The local memory-residency fix keeps verifier semantics unchanged:
`spd-product-corpus-capture --stream-live-tap-stages` still uses the full native
Q4 verifier session for greedy target tokens and draft-vocab teacher logits,
but opens live-tap stage models one at a time instead of keeping the S8 tap
stages resident. The current Qwen480 dry run emits that flag plus the capture
CUDA map `CUDA0,CUDA0,CUDA1,CUDA1,CUDA2,CUDA2,CUDA3,CUDA3`. The remaining risk
is stage-open churn inside the HF timeout cap, not a change to teacher argmax
definition.

Streamed-capture HF Job `meshllm/6a354843953ed90bfb944848` used the same
`rtx-pro-6000x4` / `4.5h` cap and uploaded artifact
`job-inputs/20260619T134535Z-595b67cb/` at commit
`9198f2468ae69dbb13c0d0a16f7b99c0e3e7dd5d`. It failed after `209` seconds
because `skippy-server` still initialized `SpdLiveTapRunnerConfig` without the
new streamed-capture fields. Commit `d19da20d` fixed that initializer. Commit
`f23e28ba` made the HF timeout configurable so the retry could keep aggregate
spend under the original `$50` intent.

The latest streamed-capture retry is HF Job
`meshllm/6a354a2f953ed90bfb94486f`, using `rtx-pro-6000x4` with a `3.5h` cap
and uploaded artifact `job-inputs/20260619T135416Z-f23e28ba/` at commit
`fc2f95dd543955f1e821c7036bebd0e48501974f`. Status on 2026-06-20 local time:
it has cleared inline bootstrap download/startup, CUDA ABI build, Rust release
builds, Python dependency setup, full 69-file Qwen480 layer-package download
(`276G / 276G`), and prompt-token shard building, then reached `capture[0]`.
It failed after `1226` seconds opening streamed tap stage `0..8`: CUDA0 could
not allocate a `34051.88 MiB` buffer while the full verifier remained resident.
At about `$11/hr`, this adds about `$3.75`, so completed Qwen480 GPU spend is
roughly `$12` to `$13`.

The local fix is a two-phase topology-only capture path. Phase 1 runs the full
verifier to record greedy target tokens and native draft-vocab logits, then
drops that model. Phase 2 opens the streamed tap runner and replays the recorded
contexts to write product rows in the same prompt/step order. This preserves
teacher semantics while avoiding full-verifier plus tap-stage residency
overlap. A real cached package smoke passed on
`meshllm_Qwen3-0_6B-Q4_K_M-layers-test-main` with `--splits 14 --layer-end 28`,
`--stream-live-tap-stages`, one prompt, one verify step, native teacher logits,
and matching product row byte counts. The remaining risk is whether native CUDA
allocator state fully frees the Qwen480 verifier buffers before phase 2; if not,
the next fix should use a process boundary or CPU tap replay.

Two-phase HF retry `meshllm/6a35536b3093dba73ce2a377`, using uploaded artifact
`job-inputs/20260619T143116Z-3d1442f8/` at revision
`abaefe222379e5bd6f949ebec7ca37de79faf715`, passed the allocator gate: after
build, package download, prompt processing, and capture startup, it logged
streamed stage `0..8` with `CUDA0 model buffer size = 34051.88 MiB` instead of
the previous `cudaMalloc` OOM. It was then manually canceled before timeout
because streamed live-tap capture reopens every tap stage for every prompt/step;
that made the full `512` train / `64` held-out / `4` verify-step lane unlikely
to reach training or smoke under the cap.

The next capped retry should keep the two-phase verifier drop but run resident
tap stages. The earlier resident-stage OOM occurred with the full verifier
still loaded; after phase 1 exits, the S8 tap stages should fit on
`rtx-pro-6000x4` using the existing two-stages-per-GPU map. The planner now
defaults to resident tap stages and emits `--stream-live-tap-stages` only when
requested. The first artifact-producing profile is `TRAIN_PROMPTS=32`,
`HELDOUT_PROMPTS=8`, `VERIFY_STEPS=1`, `STREAM_LIVE_TAP_STAGES=false`, and
`JOB_TIMEOUT=2h`, which dry-runs at about `$22` and still avoids the old
reference-train path.

Resident-small retry `meshllm/6a3563743093dba73ce2a4ab` cleared the native
mechanics gates and then failed on a generated shell quoting bug. It completed
release build, downloaded the full `69`-file / `276G` Qwen480 package, loaded
the full verifier across four RTX PRO 6000 GPUs, split verifier capture from
resident tap replay, converted native train and held-out corpora, trained the
head-only predictor with `base_model_load=skipped`, scored held-out, and
exported an `8.72GB` BF16 serving head. Train had `31 / 32` labels in draft
scope; held-out had `8 / 8`; held-out score was `2 / 8` top-1 and `5 / 8`
top-4. The generated parity-skip command used `echo ...; Rust fixture ...`, so
Bash tried to execute `Rust` and exited `127`. The planner now emits the skip
as one `printf`; local validation passes for Python compile, the resident dry
run, and the generated `rust_fixture_parity` group. The next retry should reuse
the same profile and resume at the package-smoke/upload gate.

Fixed retry `meshllm/6a356b6d3093dba73ce2a5da` was submitted with input
artifact `job-inputs/20260619T161546Z-a6dae908/`, upload revision
`f57a5053d8c1ff20ca74798dd076fcb317a6038a`, and the same 32/8/1 resident
profile. Its first new gate is continuing past the parity-skip step into
package-backed rolling smoke and artifact upload.

That fixed retry is now `ERROR` after `1383s`, but it passed the parity-skip
gate and repeated the useful native mechanics: build, full package download,
verifier load, two-phase native target/logit capture, resident tap replay,
head-only train/score, and BF16 serving export. The exported head was
`8,723,214,136` bytes with SHA
`3fcdb93eeea5d23c4ae3df3dc39e10e70f59564a2ab20820f09aa0a7a5fe3f9d`; held-out
quality on the tiny `8`-row lane was `2 / 8` top-1 and `5 / 8` top-4. The new
failure is package-smoke readiness: the baseline embedded OpenAI frontend did
not become ready and `/v1/models` was connection-refused. The next patch makes
this failure observable and artifact-safe: `spd-openai-smoke` prints bounded
stage-log tails on readiness failure; `native-package-fresh` uploads artifacts
before package smoke; and Qwen480 smoke uses `600s` startup/request timeouts
with smoke work under the uploaded artifact directory. The current local 32/8/1
dry run is still native-package-first and still avoids `AutoModelForCausalLM`,
`hf_train_eval_qwen06.py`, `spd-live-tap-parity`, and streamed tap capture.

Observable retry `meshllm/6a3575be3093dba73ce2a692` finished `ERROR` after
`1898s`, but it reached the first durable artifact checkpoint. It completed
release build, full `69`-file / `276G` package download, Qwen480 verifier load,
two-phase native target/logit capture, resident tap replay, native
train/held-out conversion, head-only train/score with `base_model_load=skipped`,
serving export, and `upload_pre_smoke`. The uploaded serving head is
`8,723,214,136` bytes with SHA
`f77dbfb1f83a1c3a79446b983c7de3e77f63c22f4bacbd8ae0d92efbeef3fc75`, under
`meshllm/skippy-spd-qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-ud-q4-k-xl-s8/runs/native-package-fresh`.
Tiny-lane held-out quality was `2 / 8` top-1 and `5 / 8` top-4, so this is not
a sidecar-quality claim.

The remaining failure is package-smoke placement. Stage logs showed stage `1`
already resident on CUDA0, then stage `0` failed allocating a `34051.88 MiB`
CUDA0 buffer; the other stages had started cleanly. `spd-openai-smoke` now
supports per-stage backend placement, and the planner/bootstrap can pass a
separate smoke map. The next capped HF step should hydrate the uploaded
artifact and run only package smoke with
`CPU,CUDA0,CPU,CUDA1,CPU,CUDA2,CPU,CUDA3`, plus latency simulation and upload,
instead of repeating capture/train. The first single-job HF meshlet remains a
follow-on only after package-backed smoke produces matched content, zero tap
failures, and useful saved/unsaved candidate-token round-trip counts.

Smoke-existing retry `meshllm/6a3581b9953ed90bfb944dd3` proved the hydration
path but failed before model launch because the second generated script ran from
the bootstrap checkout and could not resolve `target/release/skippy-bench`.
Commit `bf682379` fixes that by re-entering `$WORK_DIR/mesh-llm` before
package smoke and checking for the release binaries plus `physical-stage-ms.txt`.
Fixed retry `meshllm/6a35894f953ed90bfb944e49` reached package-backed smoke
with the same `rtx-pro-6000x4` / `1.5h` cap, artifact path, and CPU/GPU smoke
map, then ended `ERROR` after `1621s`. This run proved the cwd fix and stage
launch: package smoke ran baseline/SPD cases with downstream tap returns for
hf `16,24,32,40,48,55,62`, local stage-0 hf `8` tap records, and `0` tap
return/record/ignored failures. It did not prove proposal quality: every SPD
case produced `0` proposals because prompt-window hf `8` rows were missing from
the proposal cache. Root cause was initial source reset cleanup after prefill:
`reset_to_context(prompt)` retained zero tap rows while the SPD source context
was still empty. Stage 0 cannot recover those prompt rows through first-decode
sideband replay the way downstream stages can. The runtime now preserves
prefill tap rows on that initial source reset. The latency simulator also now
accepts the intended clumped four-physical-bucket what-if model for an
eight-stage smoke report instead of aborting on stage-count mismatch.

The next Qwen480 run should still be smoke-existing only: upload the current
patch, hydrate `runs/native-package-fresh`, reuse the same package/prompt shard,
and rerun package smoke plus latency simulation. Do not repeat capture/train
unless the uploaded artifact is unusable.
That patch bundle is now uploaded as
`job-inputs/20260619T190753Z-6abc8370/` at Hub commit
`43940c19fefce860f58c37ebe0517a13d32f8419`. A first submission
`meshllm/6a3593b5953ed90bfb944ef8` failed in `7s` with the known HF CLI
missing-`--` argument issue; no model work ran. Corrected retry
`meshllm/6a3593cf3093dba73ce2a78f` is submitted with `bash -lc`, the same
`rtx-pro-6000x4` / `1.5h` cap, artifact path, and CPU/GPU smoke map.

That corrected retry finished `COMPLETED`. It proved the request-path fix and
the package-backed Qwen480 S8 smoke mechanics: baseline/SPD content matched on
`8 / 8` prompts, tap return failures were `0`, tap record failures were `0`,
ignored taps were `0`, all `32 / 32` inline probes produced proposals, proposal
miss reasons were all `null`, and no taps were missing. The sidecar itself did
not pass quality: package-backed rolling smoke proposed `32`, accepted `0`,
rejected `32`, committed `0` optimistic tokens, and saved `0` candidate-token
round trips. The tiny held-out scorer for the uploaded artifact was only
`2 / 8` top-1 and `5 / 8` top-4, while the 32-row train fit reached
`final_argmax_acc=1.0`. Treat this as completed mechanics evidence and a
sidecar-quality failure, not a speedup signal.

The next spend-bearing Qwen480 step should therefore be a larger native quality
lane for the same S8 topology, not a meshlet. A single-job HF meshlet remains
the right end-to-end validation spike only after package-backed held-out
serving reports matched content, zero tap failures, and saved candidate-token
round trips greater than unsaved with margin.

A no-spend dry run for that larger lane is saved at
`/tmp/spd-qwen480-s8-quality-native-package-fresh-plan.json` with SHA256
`563f142b265067cdda806a9f1ff29fa8743deddca51d48f2e9c829bc93972465`. It uses
`512` train prompts, `64` held-out prompts, `4` verify steps,
`rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `4.5h`, and max cost `$49.49991`, and still avoids
the old full-reference path strings: no `AutoModelForCausalLM`, no
`hf_train_eval_qwen06.py`, no `spd-live-tap-parity`, and no `from_pretrained(`.
That lane was submitted as HF Job `meshllm/6a35cdc03093dba73ce2a9ad` and
completed in `6325s` of running time. It produced a stronger offline score than
the tiny lane (`96 / 256` native-teacher top-1, `129 / 256` top-4, and
hard-label/serving-target top-1 `94 / 224`) and exported an
`8,723,214,136` byte BF16 serving head with SHA256
`5cf3c15c54919414809cf409d252c5c4b0fa2b5ec084d91d4966e54976e75936`. The
broad package-backed rolling smoke matched baseline/SPD content on `64 / 64`
prompts with `0` tap return failures, `0` tap record failures, and `0` ignored
taps, but failed sidecar quality: `256` proposed, `0` accepted, `256`
rejected, `0` optimistic tokens committed, `0` saved candidate-token round
trips, and `256` unsaved. The latency simulation therefore reports
`paper_like_speedup_vs_serial_split=0.0` with measured sidecar cost about
`395.8ms`. This confirms broad request-path mechanics and rejects the current
sidecar as a speed candidate. The offline-versus-serving gap is now an explicit
acceptance blocker: future reports must separate draft-restricted
native-teacher top-1 from `serving_target_top1` against the full-vocab greedy
target, and the next native-package-fresh lane must pass fixed-row
Rust/Python parity before offline scores can be treated as serving-quality
evidence.

A larger no-spend paper-aligned plan is now saved at
`/tmp/spd-qwen480-s8-quality-8k-native-package-fresh-mixed-balanced-paperlike-plan.json`
with SHA256 `24e9d55378acc68f82f098dab0c954d23b68c0acda0e6bfdd4e804dfbd5ecc0c`.
It keeps Qwen480 S8 native package-first capture, raises training to `8192`
native-Q4 samples (`2048` prompts x `4` verify steps), uses `128` held-out
prompts and `ctx_size=2048`, keeps the proven resident capture map
`CUDA0,CUDA0,CUDA1,CUDA1,CUDA2,CUDA2,CUDA3,CUDA3` and CPU-interleaved smoke map
`CPU,CUDA0,CPU,CUDA1,CPU,CUDA2,CPU,CUDA3`, and moves closer to the paper recipe
with one epoch, LR `1e-4`, KL-only native teacher training, and a balanced
mixed prompt source. The selected datasets are UltraChat-200k, SmolTalk,
SmolTalk-Chinese, and a ShareGPT-like WizardLM Evol-Instruct shard.
Prompt-token generation now writes a corpus-frequency `draft-token-ids.json`
from selected training conversations, and native capture passes it with
`--draft-token-ids-file`; do not fall back to the old arbitrary `0..31999`
draft-token range for Qwen480 quality work. The plan still has the same
`$49.49991` planned cap on `rtx-pro-6000x4` and still avoids the old
full-reference path strings.
It also now exports `spd-product-parity-fixture.safetensors` from held-out
native product rows and runs `skippy-bench spd-fixture-parity` before package
smoke; `spd-serving-fixture.safetensors` remains the separate request-path
fixture for `spd-openai-smoke`.

The first mixed 8k lane was submitted as HF Job
`meshllm/6a35f141953ed90bfb945409` on 2026-06-20 01:47:45 UTC, label
`spd-qwen480-quality-8k`, run `20260620T014653Z-724af833`. It completed
bootstrap, pinned checkout, patch apply, CUDA/Rust release build, full Qwen480
package download, and entered `build_prompts[0]`. It was canceled
intentionally because prompt generation had no source-row cap and was
tokenizing all rows from million-row source datasets before selecting the
requested prompts. This was not a capture, training, parity, or request-path
failure. Estimated running cost at cancellation was about `$6.64`.

The bounded replacement is HF Job `meshllm/6a35fb70953ed90bfb94547c`, created

it keeps the same Qwen480 S8 package/topology and 8k sample target, adds
`--max-source-rows 12000`, reduces timeout to `3.9h`, and caps planned cost at
`$42.899922`. Together with the canceled run's estimated cost, the lane stays
inside the original `$50` intent. The replacement patch is pinned to base

pinned checkout, patch apply, CUDA build, bounded prompt build, native capture,
product fixture parity, and package-backed acceptance/economics.

Acceptance rate is now the primary Qwen480 research loop. The paper's recipe is
far larger than our completed Qwen480 lane: frozen target, KL-only speculation
module training, mixed ShareGPT/UltraChat/SmolTalk/SmolTalk-Chinese data, max
length `2048`, one epoch, LR `1e-4`, linear decay, and about `1.2M` filtered
samples. The next evidence should first close fixed-row Rust/Python proposal
parity, then run the prepared mixed `8k` native-Q4 lane, then scale the same
recipe to `16k`, `64k`, and paper-scale only if package-backed held-out
acceptance and saved candidate-token round trips improve.
If the mixed `8k` lane still serves `0` accepted proposals, the next step is
not a blind data increase. First run a tiny overfit-to-serving-prompts Qwen480
S8 proof on the exact package topology. Nonzero served acceptance from an
intentionally overfit head proves the path is aligned and data scale is the
likely lever; `0` served acceptance from an overfit head proves the blocker is
row/projection/live-tap alignment or Rust/Python forward parity.

Predigested SPD splits should be logical artifacts. A sidecar is trained for a
canonical logical topology and tap set; Mesh may fit contiguous logical stages
onto fewer physical nodes when hardware is scarce. That placement is only valid
if every manifest-required internal tap is still returned. Speed estimates and
wall-clock claims must use the fitted physical placement, not the logical split
count: colocating ten logical stages on three nodes preserves sidecar
compatibility but only gives three physical compute buckets.

The download model should stay close to existing Skippy split serving. Base
model layers are still resolved as layer-package parts on the physical stage
nodes. The SPD predictor bundle is coordinator-owned by default, because the
sidecar consumes gathered taps and proposes the next token for target
verification. Workers should only need the `spd_tap_return_hf_indices` allowlist
derived from the manifest. Running the sidecar on every node is not required for
the current design; it would be a separate optimization if tap transport became
the bottleneck.

If the Qwen480 S8 sidecar clears the held-out and package-backed smoke gates,
the next HF validation should be a single-job meshlet before trying multiple HF
Jobs as separate nodes. One HF Job can start a coordinator, stage servers, the
SPD sidecar, and the OpenAI frontend as separate local processes, optionally
injecting synthetic per-stage latency. That tests package materialization, tap
return, proposal/verification, rolling cleanup, and pipeline economics
repeatably. Multiple HF Jobs with exposed ports are a later transport spike,
because the HF job proxy is not the same as a normal low-latency Mesh LAN.
The dispatch gate is the sidecar result, not the networking idea: require
held-out native teacher summaries, training/scoring evidence, exported serving
artifacts, and a package-backed rolling smoke with matched content, zero tap
failures, and useful saved/unsaved candidate-token round-trip counts before
spending on the meshlet.

A later no-spend max120 product-corpus check confirmed that simply fitting the
small HF-teacher bridge harder is not enough. The
`/tmp/spd-qwen3-8b-product-prompts-paper3-train32-heldout16-max120` split
captured `712` train rows and `256` disjoint held-out rows without the earlier
live-tap `n_batch=128` assertion. HF teacher alignment stayed high
(`245 / 256` held-out teacher top-1 matches native Q4 target), but the
5-epoch HF-KL head accepted only `91 / 256` held-out proposals and the native
hard-label variant only `95 / 256`; both were fixture-parity clean and
content-exact. Do not run release/request-path timing for those heads. The next
grounded step is native Q4_K_M verifier logits, not larger generic HF-teacher
KL.

That native verifier-logit path is now implemented. `skippy-bench
spd-live-tap-parity --product-native-teacher-logits` captures Q4 product
verifier logits over the SPD draft vocabulary beside product tap rows, and
`evals/spd/prepare_native_product_teacher_logits.py` converts them to the
teacher safetensors consumed by the product-row trainer. The larger current
gate captured `548` native-Q4 train rows and `64` held-out rows for the same
`23,36` topology. Native teacher quality is coherent (`545 / 545` train labels
and `61 / 61` held-out labels match Q4 target argmax in scope). A conservative
warm start from the 16k checkpoint improved held-out from `5 / 61` to `20 / 61`
top-1 and from `14 / 61` to `33 / 61` top-4. A short regularization sweep moved
the best held-out top-1 to `22 / 61`; the best held-out top-4 was `34 / 61`.
Treat this as proof that quant-specific supervision is wired and learnable, but
still not enough quality for serving or speed claims. The next sidecar gate is
broader native-Q4 product data, and then regularization tuning against the same
held-out split.

That broader reference-pool gate has now been run without changing the frozen
held-out split. The prompt-token builder can exclude the held-out token file
while raising context limits, and
`/tmp/spd-native-teacher-train224-v8` captured `1792` native-Q4 rows from `224`
train prompts with exact native-logit bytes. Native teacher argmax matched the
Q4 target on `1763 / 1763` in-scope labels. The broadened corpus improved train
fit, but not held-out quality: the conservative warm start scored `21 / 61`
held-out top-1 and `33 / 61` top-4, while the prior top-4 recipe tied
`22 / 61` held-out top-1 but regressed top-4 to `32 / 61`. This means the
small reference-eval prompt pool is saturated; the next valid quality step is a
broader UltraChat/product prompt-token shard with native Q4 verifier logits,
still scored against the same frozen held-out tensor.

What is working:

- Real `skippy-bench spd-openai-smoke` can launch local binary stages, start the
  embedded stage-0 OpenAI frontend, load a trained Qwen3.5-4B SPD sidecar
  manifest/checkpoint, collect live hidden-state taps, run the Rust sidecar head,
  and verify accepted tokens through the target staged runtime.
- The Rust sidecar path has fixture parity coverage, live-tap parity coverage,
  OpenAI smoke report coverage, warmup/repeat reporting, and phase timing for
  tap collection, `cur_in` assembly, sidecar cache prefill, fixed projections,
  sidecar decoder layers, final norm, and LM-head/top-k.
- The target model remains the source of truth. SPD proposals only commit after
  target verification accepts them.
- The runtime rejects topologies that do not provide the hidden-state tap
  boundaries required by the sidecar manifest, which prevents silently running a
  trained sidecar against an incompatible physical split.
- The opt-in native rolling executor path (`--openai-spd-rolling-executor` /
  `skippy-bench spd-openai-smoke --spd-rolling-executor`) can now keep a
  logical `S=4` rolling queue in flight from live direct-return taps, verify the
  oldest completed entry, and report oldest-commit/drain counters from the
  request path.

First real-node split target:

- Use the pretrained `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B` S4/L4 SPD sidecar first. It is the only
  current artifact with strong reference acceptance evidence, Rust/Python
  parity, live Skippy tap parity, and a known tap-aligned physical split.
- Target GGUF: `.artifacts/spd/qwen35-4b-gguf/Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf`
  (`unsloth/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF:Q4_K_M`).
- Sidecar bundle:
  `/private/tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/20260616-152346/train/`
  with `skippy-spd-head.json`, `spd-head.safetensors`, and
  `spd-parity-fixture.safetensors`.
- Required physical split for this artifact: `8,10,16,20,24,31`, exposing taps
  `0,8,10,16,20,24,31`. Do not try a clean four-stage split with this sidecar;
  it will miss required hidden-state rows.
- Keep stage 0, the OpenAI frontend, and the SPD sidecar on the coordinator.
  Place downstream physical stages on the worker node or worker devices.

These runs answer the current overhead question: the trained head, cache reuse,
tap rows, and verification mechanics are native enough to preserve output and
reach 100% acceptance on the bounded prompt. The large local slowdown is not a
missing sidecar-cache port from the paper/reference implementation. It is the
gap between the paper/reference rolling pipeline schedule and the current
Skippy serving shape: local stage processes contend for the same machine, and
bounded optimistic verifier work still spends seconds in downstream and hidden
waits on CPU, or hundreds of milliseconds on Metal, instead of keeping a full
rolling queue continuously useful. Metal narrows the gap by about 8.4x versus
CPU SPD decode, but the run still reaches only `0.122x` SPD-vs-baseline decode
speed and remains about `32.9x` slower than the paper-shaped estimate.

This closes the earlier "diagnostic-only rolling scheduler" gap for the
request path: the server can launch younger verifier work from every eligible
tap callback and maintain a filled logical rolling queue. It is still a local
same-machine proof. It does not show the paper's distributed overlap regime and
should not be used as speedup evidence.

The clean paired case proves the happy-path shadow-KV promotion behavior over
real stage transport. The SPD-only sweep proves rejection/drain recovery over
the same split path. The checker for SPD-only reports must pass
`--require-content-match false` because no baseline half exists in that report.

Product-shaped two-stage baseline on 2026-06-18:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Report | `/private/tmp/skippy-two-stage-baseline.json` |
| Preflight | `/private/tmp/skippy-two-stage-baseline-preflight.json` |
| Topology | two physical stages, `--splits 16 --layer-end 32`, ranges `0..16` and `16..32` |
| Placement | stage 0 and OpenAI frontend on the coordinator; stage 1 on one worker |
| Runtime device choice | `--n-gpu-layers=-1`; both inspected stage logs selected Metal |
| Baseline output | 24-token bounded count prompt, finish reason `length` |

| Tap/KV evidence | no tap return failures, no tap record failures, no ignored taps |
| Cleanup | local and worker stage ports were free after the run; no worker `skippy-server` process remained |

This is the first ordinary two-stage Skippy split proof for the product shape
the speed gate should use. It is baseline-only because the current pretrained
Qwen3.5-4B S4/L4 sidecar does not match this topology. That artifact requires
the tap-aligned split `8,10,16,20,24,31`; a true two-stage split exposes only
hidden-state boundaries `16` and `32` plus the embedding row `0`. The matching
sidecar must be trained for `num_stages=2` and `stage_layer_boundaries=16,32`,
which derives tap rows `0,16,32;0,16`.

The first attempted LAN smoke with all remote stages using Metal
(`--n-gpu-layers -1`) failed before a full token because one worker was running
six Metal-backed stage processes. Stage 3 hit Metal out-of-memory on the first
`DecodeEmbd`. That failure is a placement/resource issue, not a Skippy KV or
binary-transport correctness failure. For one-worker correctness gates, use CPU
stages. For speed gates, spread stages across distinct devices/workers or reduce
the number of Metal-backed processes per worker.

Paper fidelity:

- The mechanism is paper-shaped: hidden states from target stages are converted
  into sidecar rows, the sidecar proposes a draft token, and the target verifies
  before commit.
- The sidecar is topology-bound in practice. A trained artifact can require
  hidden-state taps that do not line up with a simple `N` physical-stage split.
  The current Qwen3.5-4B proof required all tap boundaries
  `8,10,16,20,24,31`, even though the sidecar's logical topology has four SPD
  stages.
- Treat this as a logical layer-boundary contract, not a hostname contract. A
  sidecar trained for `Qwen3-8B` `23,36` may run on M4+mini, two cloud nodes, or
  two local stage servers if the stages expose `0..23` and `23..36`. If future
  placement packs adjacent logical stages onto one larger node, the sidecar can
  still be reused only when the runtime exposes every manifest-required logical
  boundary tap. This lets us precompute a small set of logical SPD topologies and
  clump contiguous stages at placement time instead of training every physical
  grouping.
- The performance claim is not proven. The current proof is CPU-heavy and either
  local or one-worker LAN placement; it does not yet reproduce the paper's useful
  overlap regime where target pipeline work and sidecar work hide each other on
  genuinely parallel hardware.
- The overhead delta is now a distributed-execution and scheduling-quality gap,
  not evidence that the paper or reference sidecar mechanics are absent. The
  reference loop keeps an `n`-slot rolling pipeline, runs target stage work and
  speculation in parallel, reuses `spec_past_kv`, and verifies/evicts the
  oldest completed entry. Skippy now has the Rust scheduler primitive, inline
  taps, cache parity, bounded chained verification evidence, and an opt-in
  request-path rolling executor, but still needs a real split run that proves
  useful overlap on distinct hardware.

## Outstanding Work

### SPD Pipeline-Fill Validation

The next SPD milestone is not more unit coverage; it is an acceptance and
candidate-round-trip savings run with enough instrumentation to explain whether
the split pipeline can stay full. Wall-clock speedup is a later claim, and only
valid after the same report shows enough accepted proposals to remove target
stage round trips on the critical path.

Open items:

- Run the multi-token baseline-vs-SPD sweep on distinct devices/nodes; both CPU
  and Metal local repeats passed correctness, but same-machine repeats are not
  speed oracles.
- For the two-node product shape, train a Qwen3.5-4B sidecar for
  `num_stages=2` and `stage_layer_boundaries=16,32` before attempting
  baseline-vs-SPD. The pretrained S4/L4 sidecar is not a valid artifact for the
  two-stage split.
- Use a topology-compatible artifact and record both logical SPD stage count and
  physical tap-aligned stage count.
- Use distinct devices or nodes so target stage work and sidecar work can
  overlap instead of competing for the same local CPU/memory bandwidth.
- Keep reporting downstream wait, sidecar cache prefill, sidecar head total,
  decoder-layer timing, accept rate, rolling gaps, and content equality.
- Treat any speedup claim as invalid unless the report includes the command,
  commit SHA, model identity, sidecar artifact identity, topology, hardware, and
  raw JSON report path. For the current two-node product proof, lead with
  accepted/proposed, saved/unsaved candidate token round trips, max in flight,
  tap failures, and content equality; do not present `paper_pipeline_estimate`
  or `paper_like_speedup_vs_serial_split` as measured speedup.

### SPD Runtime Cost Reduction

The current local native proof is dominated by costs that are not hidden in the
one-token local run.

Open items:

- Keep the stateful sidecar cache path, but do not treat cache prefill as the
  primary blocker: the 8-token CPU repeat had 24 proposal cache hits, no cache
  misses, and only 16.8 ms mean prefill after the first warm row.
- Reduce or hide downstream wait and verifier hidden wait; the 8-token CPU
  repeat spent 2681.2 ms mean normal downstream wait and 2169.6 ms mean
  optimistic hidden wait.
- Keep tightening the opt-in rolling executor until it is safe as the normal
  SPD serving path: keep multiple speculative entries useful across longer
  prompts, route returned taps by scheduler position, verify the oldest
  completed entry, and reset only on the oldest rejection.
- Add a server-side reuse path for warmup/measured requests only after request
  attribution is robust; the current benchmark intentionally isolates stage
  processes per iteration so logs are unambiguous.
- Investigate whether the required tap-boundary topology should be materialized
  as extra lightweight tap stages, fused into neighboring stages, or retrained
  for cleaner physical stage splits.

### Immediate SPD Next Runs

Run these before making any speedup claim:

1. Local all-tap baseline comparison:

   CPU status: completed on 2026-06-17 at
   `/private/tmp/spd-local-multitoken-repeat-cpu.json`. Metal status:
   completed on 2026-06-17 at
   `/private/tmp/spd-local-multitoken-repeat-metal.json`. Both preserved exact
   output and accepted `24 / 24` proposals, but SPD was still slower than
   baseline. Metal reduced SPD decode from `13964.2ms` to `1652.6ms`, which
   confirms CPU contention was real while leaving a native scheduler gap.

   ```bash
   target/release/skippy-bench spd-openai-smoke \
     --stage-server-bin target/release/skippy-server \
     --manifest <spd-head.json> \
     --fixture <spd-parity-fixture.safetensors> \
     --model-path <target.gguf> \
     --model-id local/spd-qwen35-4b \
     --splits 8,10,16,20,24,31 \
     --layer-end 32 \
     --ctx-size 128 \
     --n-gpu-layers=-1 \
     --selected-backend-device MTL0 \
     --max-tokens 8 \
     --warmup-count 1 \
     --repeat-count 3 \
     --optimistic-decode true \
     --spd-rolling-executor \
     --output /tmp/spd-openai-smoke-local-mtl-repeat.json
   ```

   This is still a contention-heavy local run, but it gives measured
   baseline/SPD pairing, repeated samples, and multi-token accept/rolling data.

2. Distinct-device or multi-node all-tap run:

   Status: one-worker CPU-backed LAN transport proofs completed on 2026-06-17
   and 2026-06-18. The latest clean paired report
   `/private/tmp/spd-lan-count-paired.json` matched baseline, accepted
   `23 / 23` SPD proposals, reached `max_in_flight=4`, had no oldest rejection
   or younger drain, and kept tap failures at zero. The follow-up SPD-only sweep
   `/private/tmp/spd-lan-mini-sweep.json` accepted `57 / 59` proposals and
   exercised one oldest rejection plus three younger drains with zero tap
   failures. This is correctness and placement evidence only; it is not a
   speedup claim.

   - keep stage 0 and the SPD sidecar on the coordinator;
   - place physical stages on distinct devices/nodes where available;
   - keep `--splits 8,10,16,20,24,31` for the current Qwen3.5-4B sidecar
     artifact unless a cleaner topology-specific sidecar is trained;
   - compare baseline/SPD decode time, downstream wait, sidecar cache prefill,
     sidecar head total, accept rate, rolling gaps, and content equality.
   - do not launch all six downstream physical stages on one worker with
     `--n-gpu-layers -1`; that oversubscribed Metal and failed with
     out-of-memory on the first decode step. Use CPU for one-worker correctness,
     or use multiple devices/workers for a real speed gate.

   First remote command shape when one worker is available and already has the
   same GGUF path. Run it once with `--preflight-only` first; that report should
   validate artifacts, splits, tap coverage, endpoint mapping, and remote model
   paths before any SSH process launch.

   ```bash
   target/release/skippy-bench spd-openai-smoke \
     --stage-server-bin target/release/skippy-server \
     --manifest /private/tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/20260616-152346/train/skippy-spd-head.json \
     --fixture /private/tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/20260616-152346/train/spd-parity-fixture.safetensors \
     --model-path .artifacts/spd/qwen35-4b-gguf/Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
     --model-id unsloth/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF:Q4_K_M \
     --splits 8,10,16,20,24,31 \
     --layer-end 32 \
     --ctx-size 128 \
     --n-gpu-layers=0 \
     --spd-n-gpu-layers=0 \
     --stage-hosts local,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker> \
     --endpoint-host-map local=<coordinator-lan-ip-or-name>,<worker>=<worker-lan-ip-or-name> \
     --remote-model-path-map <worker>=/path/on/worker/Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
     --max-tokens 1 \
     --repeat-count 1 \
     --preflight-only \
     --output /tmp/spd-qwen35-first-remote-preflight.json
   ```

   Then remove `--preflight-only` and write the real smoke report:

   ```bash
   target/release/skippy-bench spd-openai-smoke \
     --stage-server-bin target/release/skippy-server \
     --manifest /private/tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/20260616-152346/train/skippy-spd-head.json \
     --fixture /private/tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/20260616-152346/train/spd-parity-fixture.safetensors \
     --model-path .artifacts/spd/qwen35-4b-gguf/Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
     --model-id unsloth/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF:Q4_K_M \
     --splits 8,10,16,20,24,31 \
     --layer-end 32 \
     --ctx-size 128 \
     --n-gpu-layers=0 \
     --spd-n-gpu-layers=0 \
     --stage-hosts local,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker> \
     --endpoint-host-map local=<coordinator-lan-ip-or-name>,<worker>=<worker-lan-ip-or-name> \
     --remote-model-path-map <worker>=/path/on/worker/Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
     --max-tokens 8 \
     --repeat-count 1 \
     --optimistic-decode true \
     --spd-rolling-executor \
     --output /tmp/spd-qwen35-first-remote-openai.json
   ```

   Use `--rsync-model-artifacts` only if copying the 2.6 GB GGUF for the run is
   acceptable; otherwise stage the GGUF once on the worker and use
   `--remote-model-path-map`.

3. Sidecar/topology training check:

   - Use `evals/spd/hf_train_eval_qwen06.py` for the first topology-specific
     proof. It already clones/patches the reference repo, trains/evaluates,
     exports the Skippy manifest, and supports `--stage-layer-boundaries` plus
     explicit `--shallow-hidden-layer-indices`.
   - For the two-node product split, train a Qwen3.5-4B S2/L4 sidecar before
     running SPD. The command shape is:

     ```bash
     python3 evals/spd/hf_train_eval_qwen06.py \
       --work-dir /tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-s2-16 \
       --model-name Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B \
       --dataset HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k \
       --dataset-split train_sft \
       --train-rows 8192 \
       --eval-rows-per-set 32 \
       --num-stages 2 \
       --stage-layer-boundaries 16,32 \
       --num-spec-layers 4 \
       --max-length 512 \
       --max-new-tokens 64 \
       --draft-top-k 4 \
       --device mps \
       --upload-repo ''
     ```

     After training, export `spd-head.safetensors`, export a parity fixture,
     run fixture parity, run live-tap parity with `--splits 16 --layer-end 32`,
     and only then run the paired two-node
     `spd-openai-smoke --run-baseline true --run-spd true
     --spd-rolling-executor` gate.
   - Do not blindly reuse the pretrained Qwen3.5 S4/L4 tap layout for a cleaner
     physical split. For any intended Skippy split, write the exact tap rows
     first, then train/evaluate the sidecar against those rows.
   - For the current larger dense proof, use `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` with the
     product-shaped two-stage topology already observed through Mesh:
     `num_stages=2`, `stage_layer_boundaries=23,36`, `num_spec_layers=4`,
     greedy/no-thinking eval, and a `32k` draft vocab cap. The manifest/export
     path must carry the Qwen3 rotary metadata (`rope_theta=1000000`,
     `rotary_dim=128`) so Rust serving uses the same head math as the
     reference. Do not reuse the pretrained Qwen3.5-4B `8,10,16,20,24,31`
     physical split as a training topology.
   - The first 512-row local BF16 Qwen3-8B S2 `23,36` head is a plumbing and
     parity checkpoint, not a speed candidate. After fixing the reference
     single-chain evaluator for custom boundaries, serving-equivalent
     `draft_top_k=1` eval accepted only `12 / 384` draft flags
     (`3.23%` theoretical gain), and package-backed serving accepted `0 / 90`
     proposals across the six-prompt smoke. Scale or change the training recipe
     before spending a two-node speed run on this topology.
   - A repeat 512-row run with the paper/reference LR `1e-4` improved
     reference top-1 acceptance to `41 / 384` flags (`7.50%` theoretical gain)
     and produced the first nonzero Qwen3-8B package-backed serving acceptance
     on matched GSM8K prompts: `2 / 120` proposals accepted with clean taps.
     It still accepted `0 / 90` on the original code/math/writing sweep, so it
     is evidence that the recipe direction is better, not a speed candidate.
   - The first broader product-row bridge captured `192` train rows and `96`
     held-out rows from the exact Q4 layer package, attached HF teacher logits,
     fine-tuned from the LR `1e-4` checkpoint, and exported a BF16 serving
     bundle that passes Rust fixture parity. Held-out live-tap acceptance is
     `39 / 96`; held-out all-local OpenAI rolling acceptance is `30 / 82` with
     exact content and `0` tap failures. This is a real generalization signal,
     but it is still below two-stage break-even: `paper_pipeline_estimate` is
     `0.73x`.
   - Native Q4_K_M verifier-logit capture is now available for the same
     product rows with `--product-native-teacher-logits`. The current
     warm-start gate from the 16k checkpoint learned `548` train rows and
     improved held-out to `22 / 61` top-1 in the best regularized sweep, with
     held-out top-4 at `33 / 61` to `34 / 61`. That is a material quality
     signal, but still below a speed-candidate threshold, so the next gate is
     broader same-topology native-Q4 data plus regularization tuning with
     held-out prompts kept separate, not a speed run.
   - The serving-shaped UltraChat-native gate is now larger and more useful
     than the earlier `61`-row reference held-out set. The prompt shard
     `/private/tmp/spd-qwen3-8b-ultrachat-serving-v1-max480` uses
     `HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k` `train_sft`, Qwen no-thinking rendering,
     seed `23`, `1024` train prompts, and `256` held-out prompts. Held-out
     native-Q4 capture wrote `1024` samples with `983 / 1024` labels in draft
     scope. On this gate the original 16k head scored `106 / 983` top-1 and
     `208 / 983` top-4, while the current best scaled UltraChat-native
     warm-start
     `/tmp/spd-native-q4-adapt-ultrachat-serving-v1-train1024-v4-ctx1024-e5-lr2e6-hard01/`
     scored `383 / 983` top-1 and `574 / 983` top-4. This is a real
     quant-specific improvement, but still needs request-path accepted/proposed
     and paper-estimate evidence before any speed claim. The exported serving
     bundle has SHA
     `cab69fd4a9405819dc1a51afe058f1617995d0858702a2510313d600158349fe`
     and passes Rust fixture parity. A bounded local package-backed rolling
     smoke on the first `16` UltraChat held-out prompts matched content on
     `16 / 16`, had `0` tap failures, proposed `41`, accepted `19`, rejected
     `22`, and reported `paper_like_speedup_vs_serial_split=0.9268x`. This is
     a near-miss pipeline-fill quality gate, not measured speed evidence. The
     direct native-Q4 path needs raw tap-concat rows before any `stage_projs`
     projection plus training through `stage_projs`; the current projected
     product rows are only valid for warm-start adaptation from the same
     checkpoint projection basis, not merely the same logical topology.
     The raw path is now implemented and smoke-tested at the
     corpus/trainer/scorer level: product captures can include `raw_rows.f32`,
     the converter emits `raw_tap_concat` plus offsets, and the trainer/scorer
     support `--input-mode raw`. The live smoke at
     `/tmp/spd-raw-corpus-smoke-20260619` captured `3` samples with exact raw
     byte counts and native Q4 teacher logits; a tiny fresh raw overfit reached
     `1 / 3` top-1 and `3 / 3` top-4. Treat that as direct-training plumbing
     evidence only. The first disjoint raw gate at
     `/tmp/spd-raw-gate-20260619` has train16 and heldout16 corpora with `64`
     rows each; fresh raw training scored only `4 / 59` held-out top-1 and
     `5 / 59` top-4 in scope, while the existing current-best checkpoint scores
     the same held-out raw gate at `24 / 59` top-1 and `41 / 59` top-4. The
     train64 raw adaptation from the current-best checkpoint then improved
     heldout top-1 to `28 / 59` and passed local package-backed rolling smoke:
     content matched `16 / 16`, tap failures were `0`, proposals were
     `22 / 39` accepted, and the pipeline-fill estimate crossed break-even at
     `22` saved versus `17` unsaved candidate token round trips
     (`paper_like_speedup_vs_serial_split=1.1282x`). This is acceptance and
     round-trip-savings evidence, not local wall-clock speed evidence; measured
     local decode remains slower because of same-machine contention and
     sidecar/rolling overhead.
     The broader heldout64 gate is stricter and is now the promotion gate:
     `256` rows from `64` UltraChat held-out prompts with `241` in-scope labels
     and no overlap with train shards. Train128 improved offline heldout64 to
     `101 / 241` top-1 and `146 / 241` top-4, exported cleanly, and passed Rust
     fixture parity, but local package-backed rolling smoke on all `64` prompts
     accepted only `62 / 168` proposals. That is `62` saved versus `106`
     unsaved candidate token round trips
     (`paper_like_speedup_vs_serial_split=0.7381x`), despite exact content and
     `0` tap failures. Train256 improves offline heldout64 to `107 / 241`
     top-1 and `148 / 241` top-4, but this is still below the broad acceptance
     level needed for a real-node timing run. Do not use the old heldout16 win
     as promotion evidence.
   - Run a local or dry-run HF job on `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` only when debugging the
     trainer/export path itself. It is no longer the next scaling target now
     that the Qwen3.5-4B request path has real LAN KV evidence.
   - The immediate larger-model target is now Qwen3-Coder-480B S8 on Hugging
     Face, using the existing
     `meshllm/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-UD-Q4_K_XL-layers` Skippy package.
     Use a native-package-first qualification path: staged package smoke, raw
     tap-concat capture, native quant verifier logits/top-k, SPD sidecar
     training, held-out scoring, serving export, package-backed rolling smoke,
     and latency simulation. Start with logical S8 boundaries
     `8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62`, vocab size `151936`, and required taps
     `[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62]` over the normal Skippy layer package.
   - SPD should not create separate model-layer artifacts. Skippy owns the
     physical layer ranges and downloads/materializes the layer package; SPD
     owns logical tap requirements and proposal weights. The coordinator runs
     the sidecar. Workers need only the manifest-derived tap-return allowlist.
     Mesh may colocate contiguous logical SPD stages onto fewer physical nodes
     only if those nodes still return all internal logical-boundary taps.
   - The first Qwen480 S8 HF lane was capped at `$50`: `rtx-pro-6000x4` for
     `4.5h` planned at `$49.50`. The latest retry used the same flavor for
     `3.5h`, planned around `$38.50`; the next retry should use the two-phase
     capture patch under the same cap unless dry-run cost changes. `h200x2` can run `5h` at
     about `$50` but is tight on VRAM for a `256.98 GiB` package, and `h200x4`
     is safer on memory but only buys `2.5h` under the same cap. Do not use the
     full-HF-reference trainer for this target; the job must train from native
     package tap rows and native Q4 verifier logits without loading the full
     Qwen480 base model through Transformers. The current `native-package-fresh` dry run uses
     topology-only capture plus head-only train/score, exports a product-row
     parity fixture plus `spd-serving-fixture.safetensors`, and runs Rust
     fixture parity before package smoke. Dry-run
     model/package ref, dataset shard, topology, row cap, hardware, timeout,
     output repo, max cost, and whether the command is
     topology-only/capture-only/training-capable before submitting spend.
   - Record the sidecar manifest's required hidden-state indices alongside every
     benchmark topology. Prefer a sidecar whose required taps match the intended
     mesh stage layout; otherwise the runtime must either create extra tap
     stages or fuse tap collection into neighboring stages.

### Batched Target Verification

Verification is still the governor. Warm n-gram runs show useful acceptance, but
the live staged path still spends too much wall time in target verification,
stage forwarding, and repair bookkeeping.

Open items:

- Investigate true batched target verification for multi-token n-gram spans.
- Reduce per-window protocol round trips and per-stage bookkeeping overhead.
- Compare block verification against tree-style verification before adding a
  larger public protocol surface.
- Keep measuring `verify_wall_ms`, verifier compute, downstream wait, protocol
  request count, protocol token count, max span, and average span.

### Rejection Repair

Early rejection still hurts n-gram more than proposal quality alone suggests.
The first-token early-reject fast path exists, but wider windows still pay too
much restore/reverify overhead.

Open items:

- Make repair decisions cost-aware, not only confidence/window-size aware.
- Preserve the tail-reject fast path.
- Avoid repair `VerifySpan` when a normal decode step is cheaper.
- Track repair cost by task type, not only globally.

### Pool Policy And Lifetime

N-gram pools are valuable while the user is iterating in the same context. They
are less valuable after a project/session has gone cold.

Open items:

- Add explicit pool TTL and LRU eviction policy.
- Keep pools in memory by default; avoid disk persistence until there is a clear
  reproducibility or resume requirement.
- Consider separate retention classes for session pools, project pools, and
  tenant-wide warm pools.
- Expose pool memory usage and candidate counts in telemetry.

### Concurrent Sessions

The server path needs to be boringly reliable under many prompt workers.

Open items:

- Stress-test `ngram-pool-server` with many concurrent session IDs.
- Shard or partition pool locks if contention appears.
- Verify pool keys include model, tokenizer, tenant, project, session, explicit
  pool ID, and n-gram size.
- Ensure failed or cancelled requests only observe accepted target tokens.

### Routing Policy

The OpenAI-compatible frontend should eventually route coding-shaped requests to
n-gram speculation before draft speculation when the session/project pool is
warm enough.

Open items:

- Add a conservative coding-prompt detector for file paths, fenced code, diffs,
  compiler errors, stack traces, tests, symbols, and tool logs.
- Use acceptance and verifier-cost telemetry to disable or shrink n-gram windows
  when a session is not benefiting.
- Keep routing as a performance policy only; correctness must always come from
  target verification.

### Benchmark Coverage

The current numbers are useful but not enough to lock policy.

Open items:

- Continue using HF-sourced benchmark corpora instead of checked-in large
  prompt bodies.
- Keep smoke and long tiers for all benchmark modes, not only speculation.
- Run warm coding-loop confirmation regularly because that is the expected
  n-gram win case.
- Report by task type, especially coding versus chat/instruction.
- Preserve raw logs under `target/prompt-spec-corpus/<timestamp>` for audit.

## Done Criteria For Promotion

N-gram should become an automatic first-choice coding strategy only after:

- warm coding-loop runs show consistent speedup over baseline;
- verifier wall time decreases, not just acceptance rate increasing;
- concurrent session stress runs do not show lock contention or pool bleed;
- telemetry can explain why a session enabled, shrank, or disabled n-gram;
- regression runs include at least smoke and long corpus tiers.
