# Speculative Decoding Outstanding Work

This note tracks open work for n-gram speculative decoding and SPD sidecar
serving. Broader staged-serving design lives in [`../SKIPPY.md`](../SKIPPY.md),
and benchmark command/report guidance lives in
[`../../crates/skippy-bench/README.md`](../../crates/skippy-bench/README.md).

## Current State

### N-Gram

N-gram speculative decoding is implemented and useful, especially for repeated
coding/editing sessions. It is model-free: the pool observes accepted target
tokens, proposes continuations when a context suffix repeats, and the staged
target verifies every proposed token through `VerifySpan`.

Current policy:

- Use n-gram speculation for coding-shaped sessions and repeated edit loops.
- Do not expect large wins on cold, one-shot, open-ended chat.
- Keep the default n-gram confidence policy flat at 55% until the verifier path
  is redesigned around actual verifier cost.
- Treat n-gram pooling as independent from KV/full-state cache. It remains safe
  for recurrent families such as Qwen3.6 because it does not restore model
  state.

### SPD Sidecar

Status as of 2026-06-17: SPD is a real native request-path proof, but not a
speedup proof yet.

What is working:

- Real `skippy-bench spd-openai-smoke` can launch local binary stages, start the
  embedded stage-0 OpenAI frontend, load a trained Qwen3.5-4B SPD sidecar
  manifest/checkpoint, collect live hidden-state taps, run the Rust sidecar head,
  and verify accepted tokens through the target staged runtime.
- The Rust sidecar path has fixture parity coverage, live-tap parity coverage,
  OpenAI smoke report coverage, warmup/repeat reporting, and phase timing for
  tap collection, `cur_in` assembly, sidecar cache prefill, fixed projections,
  sidecar decoder layers, final norm, and LM-head/top-k.
- The target model remains the source of truth. SPD proposals only commit after
  target verification accepts them.
- The runtime rejects topologies that do not provide the hidden-state tap
  boundaries required by the sidecar manifest, which prevents silently running a
  trained sidecar against an incompatible physical split.

First real-node split target:

- Use the pretrained `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B` S4/L4 SPD sidecar first. It is the only
  current artifact with strong reference acceptance evidence, Rust/Python
  parity, live Skippy tap parity, and a known tap-aligned physical split.
- Target GGUF: `.artifacts/spd/qwen35-4b-gguf/Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf`
  (`unsloth/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF:Q4_K_M`).
- Sidecar bundle:
  `/private/tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/20260616-152346/train/`
  with `skippy-spd-head.json`, `spd-head.safetensors`, and
  `spd-parity-fixture.safetensors`.
- Required physical split for this artifact: `8,10,16,20,24,31`, exposing taps
  `0,8,10,16,20,24,31`. Do not try a clean four-stage split with this sidecar;
  it will miss required hidden-state rows.
- Keep stage 0, the OpenAI frontend, and the SPD sidecar on the coordinator.
  Place downstream physical stages on the worker node or worker devices.

This run answers the current overhead question: the trained head, cache reuse,
tap rows, and verification mechanics are native enough to preserve output and
reach 100% acceptance on the bounded prompt. The large local slowdown is not a
missing sidecar-cache port from the paper/reference implementation. It is the
gap between the paper/reference rolling pipeline schedule and the current
Skippy serving shape: local stage processes contend for the same machine, and
bounded optimistic verifier work still spends seconds in downstream and hidden
waits instead of keeping a full rolling queue continuously useful.

First remote preflight on 2026-06-17:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Report | `/private/tmp/spd-qwen35-first-remote-preflight.json` |
| Mode | `spd-openai-preflight`; no stages launched |
| Artifact checks | `skippy-server` stat succeeded; GGUF stat succeeded; serving checkpoint has 66 tensors; parity fixture has 28 tensors |
| Logical/physical topology | logical SPD stages 4; physical stages 7 |
| Split/tap check | `8,10,16,20,24,31` exposes tap returns `8,10,16,20,24,31` |
| Remote plan | stage 0 local with checked port 20031, stages 1-6 assigned to one worker endpoint plan |
| Warnings | none for the complete fake endpoint/model-path map |

Paper fidelity:

- The mechanism is paper-shaped: hidden states from target stages are converted
  into sidecar rows, the sidecar proposes a draft token, and the target verifies
  before commit.
- The sidecar is topology-bound in practice. A trained artifact can require
  hidden-state taps that do not line up with a simple `N` physical-stage split.
  The current Qwen3.5-4B proof required all tap boundaries
  `8,10,16,20,24,31`, even though the sidecar's logical topology has four SPD
  stages.
- The performance claim is not proven. The local proof is single-machine,
  process-heavy, mostly CPU-bound, and one-token. It does not yet reproduce the
  paper's useful overlap regime where target pipeline work and sidecar work hide
  each other on genuinely parallel hardware.
- The overhead delta is a serving/scheduler gap, not evidence that the paper or
  reference sidecar mechanics are absent. The reference loop keeps an `n`-slot
  rolling pipeline, runs target stage work and speculation in parallel, reuses
  `spec_past_kv`, and verifies/evicts the oldest completed entry. Skippy has
  the Rust scheduler primitive, inline taps, cache parity, and bounded chained
  verification evidence, but still needs that rolling executor as the native
  serving path.

## Outstanding Work

### SPD Speedup Validation

The next SPD milestone is not more unit coverage; it is an end-to-end speedup
run with enough instrumentation to explain the result.

Open items:

- Repeat the multi-token baseline-vs-SPD sweep on Metal and then on distinct
  devices/nodes; the CPU repeat passed correctness but is not a speed oracle.
- Use a topology-compatible artifact and record both logical SPD stage count and
  physical tap-aligned stage count.
- Use distinct devices or nodes so target stage work and sidecar work can
  overlap instead of competing for the same local CPU/memory bandwidth.
- Keep reporting downstream wait, sidecar cache prefill, sidecar head total,
  decoder-layer timing, accept rate, rolling gaps, and content equality.
- Treat any speedup claim as invalid unless the report includes the command,
  commit SHA, model identity, sidecar artifact identity, topology, hardware, and
  raw JSON report path.

### SPD Runtime Cost Reduction

The current local native proof is dominated by costs that are not hidden in the
one-token local run.

Open items:

- Keep the stateful sidecar cache path, but do not treat cache prefill as the
  primary blocker: the 8-token CPU repeat had 24 proposal cache hits, no cache
  misses, and only 16.8 ms mean prefill after the first warm row.
- Reduce or hide downstream wait and verifier hidden wait; the 8-token CPU
  repeat spent 2681.2 ms mean normal downstream wait and 2169.6 ms mean
  optimistic hidden wait.
- Turn the paper/reference rolling scheduler from diagnostics into the serving
  executor: keep multiple speculative entries in flight, route returned taps by
  scheduler position, verify the oldest completed entry, and reset only on the
  oldest rejection.
- Add a server-side reuse path for warmup/measured requests only after request
  attribution is robust; the current benchmark intentionally isolates stage
  processes per iteration so logs are unambiguous.
- Investigate whether the required tap-boundary topology should be materialized
  as extra lightweight tap stages, fused into neighboring stages, or retrained
  for cleaner physical stage splits.

### Immediate SPD Next Runs

Run these before making any speedup claim:

1. Local all-tap baseline comparison:

   CPU status: completed on 2026-06-17 at
   `/private/tmp/spd-local-multitoken-repeat-cpu.json`. It preserved exact
   output for all measured pairs and accepted `24 / 24` proposals, but SPD was
   still much slower than baseline because local downstream/hidden waits
   dominated. A Metal run is still useful as a contention diagnostic, not as a
   final speed claim.

   ```bash
   target/release/skippy-bench spd-openai-smoke \
     --stage-server-bin target/release/skippy-server \
     --manifest <spd-head.json> \
     --fixture <spd-parity-fixture.safetensors> \
     --model-path <target.gguf> \
     --model-id local/spd-qwen35-4b \
     --splits 8,10,16,20,24,31 \
     --layer-end 32 \
     --ctx-size 128 \
     --n-gpu-layers=-1 \
     --selected-backend-device MTL0 \
     --max-tokens 8 \
     --warmup-count 1 \
     --repeat-count 3 \
     --output /tmp/spd-openai-smoke-local-mtl-repeat.json
   ```

   This is still a contention-heavy local run, but it gives measured
   baseline/SPD pairing, repeated samples, and multi-token accept/rolling data.

2. Distinct-device or multi-node all-tap run:

   - keep stage 0 and the SPD sidecar on the coordinator;
   - place physical stages on distinct devices/nodes where available;
   - keep `--splits 8,10,16,20,24,31` for the current Qwen3.5-4B sidecar
     artifact unless a cleaner topology-specific sidecar is trained;
   - compare baseline/SPD decode time, downstream wait, sidecar cache prefill,
     sidecar head total, accept rate, rolling gaps, and content equality.

   First remote command shape when one worker is available and already has the
   same GGUF path. Run it once with `--preflight-only` first; that report should
   validate artifacts, splits, tap coverage, endpoint mapping, and remote model
   paths before any SSH process launch.

   ```bash
   target/release/skippy-bench spd-openai-smoke \
     --stage-server-bin target/release/skippy-server \
     --manifest /private/tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/20260616-152346/train/skippy-spd-head.json \
     --fixture /private/tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/20260616-152346/train/spd-parity-fixture.safetensors \
     --model-path .artifacts/spd/qwen35-4b-gguf/Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
     --model-id unsloth/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF:Q4_K_M \
     --splits 8,10,16,20,24,31 \
     --layer-end 32 \
     --ctx-size 128 \
     --n-gpu-layers=-1 \
     --stage-hosts local,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker> \
     --endpoint-host-map local=<coordinator-lan-ip-or-name>,<worker>=<worker-lan-ip-or-name> \
     --remote-model-path-map <worker>=/path/on/worker/Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
     --max-tokens 1 \
     --repeat-count 1 \
     --preflight-only \
     --output /tmp/spd-qwen35-first-remote-preflight.json
   ```

   Then remove `--preflight-only` and write the real smoke report:

   ```bash
   target/release/skippy-bench spd-openai-smoke \
     --stage-server-bin target/release/skippy-server \
     --manifest /private/tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/20260616-152346/train/skippy-spd-head.json \
     --fixture /private/tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/20260616-152346/train/spd-parity-fixture.safetensors \
     --model-path .artifacts/spd/qwen35-4b-gguf/Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
     --model-id unsloth/Qwen3.5-4B-GGUF:Q4_K_M \
     --splits 8,10,16,20,24,31 \
     --layer-end 32 \
     --ctx-size 128 \
     --n-gpu-layers=-1 \
     --stage-hosts local,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker>,<worker> \
     --endpoint-host-map local=<coordinator-lan-ip-or-name>,<worker>=<worker-lan-ip-or-name> \
     --remote-model-path-map <worker>=/path/on/worker/Qwen3.5-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf \
     --max-tokens 1 \
     --repeat-count 1 \
     --output /tmp/spd-qwen35-first-remote-openai.json
   ```

   Use `--rsync-model-artifacts` only if copying the 2.6 GB GGUF for the run is
   acceptable; otherwise stage the GGUF once on the worker and use
   `--remote-model-path-map`.

3. Sidecar/topology training check:

   - Use `evals/spd/hf_train_eval_qwen06.py` for the first topology-specific
     proof. It already clones/patches the reference repo, trains/evaluates,
     exports the Skippy manifest, and supports `--stage-layer-boundaries` plus
     explicit `--shallow-hidden-layer-indices`.
   - Do not blindly reuse the pretrained Qwen3.5 S4/L4 tap layout for a cleaner
     physical split. For any intended Skippy split, write the exact tap rows
     first, then train/evaluate the sidecar against those rows.
   - For a clean four-boundary topology, start on `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` locally or
     in a dry-run HF job with explicit tap rows that match the planned
     boundaries. Promote to Qwen3.5-4B only after export, parity fixture, and
     live tap proof pass.
   - Record the sidecar manifest's required hidden-state indices alongside every
     benchmark topology. Prefer a sidecar whose required taps match the intended
     mesh stage layout; otherwise the runtime must either create extra tap
     stages or fuse tap collection into neighboring stages.

### Batched Target Verification

Verification is still the governor. Warm n-gram runs show useful acceptance, but
the live staged path still spends too much wall time in target verification,
stage forwarding, and repair bookkeeping.

Open items:

- Investigate true batched target verification for multi-token n-gram spans.
- Reduce per-window protocol round trips and per-stage bookkeeping overhead.
- Compare block verification against tree-style verification before adding a
  larger public protocol surface.
- Keep measuring `verify_wall_ms`, verifier compute, downstream wait, protocol
  request count, protocol token count, max span, and average span.

### Rejection Repair

Early rejection still hurts n-gram more than proposal quality alone suggests.
The first-token early-reject fast path exists, but wider windows still pay too
much restore/reverify overhead.

Open items:

- Make repair decisions cost-aware, not only confidence/window-size aware.
- Preserve the tail-reject fast path.
- Avoid repair `VerifySpan` when a normal decode step is cheaper.
- Track repair cost by task type, not only globally.

### Pool Policy And Lifetime

N-gram pools are valuable while the user is iterating in the same context. They
are less valuable after a project/session has gone cold.

Open items:

- Add explicit pool TTL and LRU eviction policy.
- Keep pools in memory by default; avoid disk persistence until there is a clear
  reproducibility or resume requirement.
- Consider separate retention classes for session pools, project pools, and
  tenant-wide warm pools.
- Expose pool memory usage and candidate counts in telemetry.

### Concurrent Sessions

The server path needs to be boringly reliable under many prompt workers.

Open items:

- Stress-test `ngram-pool-server` with many concurrent session IDs.
- Shard or partition pool locks if contention appears.
- Verify pool keys include model, tokenizer, tenant, project, session, explicit
  pool ID, and n-gram size.
- Ensure failed or cancelled requests only observe accepted target tokens.

### Routing Policy

The OpenAI-compatible frontend should eventually route coding-shaped requests to
n-gram speculation before draft speculation when the session/project pool is
warm enough.

Open items:

- Add a conservative coding-prompt detector for file paths, fenced code, diffs,
  compiler errors, stack traces, tests, symbols, and tool logs.
- Use acceptance and verifier-cost telemetry to disable or shrink n-gram windows
  when a session is not benefiting.
- Keep routing as a performance policy only; correctness must always come from
  target verification.

### Benchmark Coverage

The current numbers are useful but not enough to lock policy.

Open items:

- Continue using HF-sourced benchmark corpora instead of checked-in large
  prompt bodies.
- Keep smoke and long tiers for all benchmark modes, not only speculation.
- Run warm coding-loop confirmation regularly because that is the expected
  n-gram win case.
- Report by task type, especially coding versus chat/instruction.
- Preserve raw logs under `target/prompt-spec-corpus/<timestamp>` for audit.

## Done Criteria For Promotion

N-gram should become an automatic first-choice coding strategy only after:

- warm coding-loop runs show consistent speedup over baseline;
- verifier wall time decreases, not just acceptance rate increasing;
- concurrent session stress runs do not show lock contention or pool bleed;
- telemetry can explain why a session enabled, shrank, or disabled n-gram;
- regression runs include at least smoke and long corpus tiers.
