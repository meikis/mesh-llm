# GLM 4.7 SPD-on-MTP Eval Notes

This directory contains the reproducible training, export, and latency-model
tools for the GLM 4.7 SPD-on-MTP experiment. The active path is to train a new
GLM 4.7 sidecar head, export it as a Skippy-readable artifact, and use verified
target decoding to decide whether SPD can provide useful `N > 1` draft tokens.

SPD is treated here as a separate trained sidecar head. It proposes draft tokens
from selected target-model hidden states; the target model still verifies every
accepted token. The work in this directory proves the training/evaluation path
and records the artifact contract Skippy needs before serving the head from
Rust.

The Qwen results below are background evidence from the donor proof. They are
useful because they show that SPD can be a strong wide drafting oracle, but they
are not the model-selection target for this branch.

## What Works

- GLM 4.7 checkpoint inspection, non-uniform stage-boundary metadata, and smoke
  artifact generation are supported through `glm47_frontload.py`.
- The reference training wrapper accepts explicit GLM tap rows derived from
  `--stage-layer-boundaries 15,31,47` and can build a GLM-tokenizer draft vocab
  for smoke runs.
- The training wrapper can now emit a generic contiguous-layer topology plan
  that records randomized logical hidden-state tap layouts without training a
  fixed-stage head.
- `generic_layer_tap_sidecar.py` can train, evaluate, and export a
  topology-independent layer-tap sidecar that uses logical hidden-state taps,
  tap features, randomized contiguous layouts, and tap dropout metadata instead
  of fixed stage projection tensors.
- A real SPD head can be trained locally for `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` with the paper's
  reference implementation.
- A real pretrained SPD head for `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B` reaches high acceptance on
  local eval prompts.
- Real per-sample SPD eval traces can be fed into a Skippy split-stage latency
  model to estimate how much pipeline bubble/activation-hop latency SPD can
  hide.
- `skippy-runtime` can parse and validate the SPD head manifest/checkpoint
  binding, including a Rust-readable safetensors serving checkpoint. It does
  not execute the head yet.

## What Does Not Work Yet

- We have not trained a topology-independent GLM 4.7 production sidecar for
  this branch yet.
- The donor SPD architecture still owns fixed `stage_projs.{stage}` projection
  tensors. Use `generic_layer_tap_sidecar.py` for the topology-independent path
  instead of extending the donor head further.
- We have not established generic GLM sidecar acceptance/EAL across
  `N=1,2,4,8`.
- Skippy/Rust does not yet run the SPD head forward pass.
- Skippy does not yet expose the live hidden-state taps required by the head.
- No live Skippy generation request has used trained SPD proposals yet.
- The `.pt` checkpoint is a proof/training artifact. Export it to
  `spd-head.safetensors` before Rust-side serving work.

## Open Training Data

The local Qwen3-0.6B proof uses:

- dataset: `HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k`
- split: `train_sft`
- rows: first `1024` rows for the recorded local proof

The reference SPD repository lists the intended training corpus family as:

- UltraChat-200k
- ShareGPT
- SmolTalk
- SmolTalk-Chinese

MT-Bench, HumanEval, and GSM8K prompts are used here only for evaluation.

## GLM 4.7 Frontload Smoke Path

`glm47_frontload.py` inspects a local GLM 4.7 checkpoint and writes a tiny
manifest-compatible SPD smoke artifact before any long training run. This is
for frontloading integration risk: GLM model metadata, non-uniform stage
boundaries, hidden-state tap rows, and Rust manifest validation. The generated
weights are shape fixtures, not a trained SPD head.

The default local checkpoint path points at the cached `zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash`
snapshot when present. Override it with `--model-path` on another machine.

```bash
python evals/spd/glm47_frontload.py \
  --model-path /path/to/GLM-4.7-Flash \
  --work-dir /tmp/skippy-spd-glm47-frontload \
  --num-stages 3 \
  --stage-layer-boundaries 15,31,47 \
  --num-spec-layers 1 \
  --draft-vocab-size 8 \
  --write-smoke-artifacts
```

The command writes:

- `glm47-spd-frontload.json` — checkpoint inspection and derived topology
- `speculation_head_final.pt` — placeholder provenance file
- `spd-head.safetensors` — tiny Rust-readable serving shape fixture
- `skippy-spd-head.json` — manifest with `stage_layer_boundaries`

Validate the smoke manifest without building native llama.cpp:

```bash
SKIPPY_SPD_MANIFEST=/tmp/skippy-spd-glm47-frontload/glm47-spd-frontload/skippy-spd-head.json \
  cargo test -p skippy-runtime --features dynamic-native-runtime \
  validates_external_manifest_when_skippy_spd_manifest_is_set
```

The inspected local GLM 4.7 Flash checkpoint currently reports
`model_type = glm4_moe_lite`, architecture `Glm4MoeLiteForCausalLM`,
`num_hidden_layers = 47`, `hidden_size = 2048`, `vocab_size = 154880`, and
layer-47 auxiliary tensors `eh_proj`, `enorm`, and `hnorm`. Because 47 target
layers do not divide evenly into the old equal-stage assumptions, GLM SPD
manifests carry explicit `stage_layer_boundaries`.

### GLM Training Smoke Command

After the frontload smoke passes, run a tiny real training smoke with a
tokenizer-specific draft vocab. This is not a model-quality run; it verifies
that the reference trainer can load GLM, accept the non-uniform tap topology,
produce a real `speculation_head_final.pt`, and write a Skippy manifest.

```bash
python evals/spd/hf_train_eval_qwen06.py \
  --work-dir /tmp/skippy-spd-glm47-train-smoke \
  --model-name /path/to/GLM-4.7-Flash \
  --dataset HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k \
  --dataset-split train_sft \
  --train-rows 8 \
  --skip-eval \
  --num-stages 3 \
  --stage-layer-boundaries 15,31,47 \
  --num-spec-layers 1 \
  --max-length 128 \
  --batch-size 1 \
  --gradient-accumulation-steps 1 \
  --build-draft-vocab-size 1024 \
  --draft-vocab-json '' \
  --device cuda \
  --upload-repo none
```

`--stage-layer-boundaries` derives the reference trainer's
`--shallow_hidden_layer_indices` as `0,15,31,47;0,15,31;0,15`. You can override
that directly with `--shallow-hidden-layer-indices` when testing another tap
layout. `--build-draft-vocab-size` builds a GLM-tokenizer draft vocab from the
loaded training rows and passes the generated JSON into the reference trainer.

The first GLM 4.7 smoke artifact is uploaded to the private Hugging Face model
repo `meshllm/skippy-spd-glm47-train-smoke`. It contains the Skippy manifest,
the Rust-readable `spd-head.safetensors` export, the original reference
`speculation_head_final.pt`, and a smoke-focused model card. This artifact is
for training/export/manifest validation only, not production-quality decoding.

## Generic Topology Plan

The generic GLM 4.7 sidecar target is not "train one head for
`15,31,47`." Skippy nodes may carry any contiguous layer ranges, so the head
must learn from logical hidden-state evidence:

- hidden-state index `0` means token embeddings before layer 0
- hidden-state index `k` means the output after target layer `k - 1`
- physical hosts only decide which logical taps are cheap to expose

Use `--topology-policy generic-plan` to write randomized contiguous-layer
layouts and tap rows before implementing or launching generic training:

```bash
python evals/spd/hf_train_eval_qwen06.py \
  --topology-policy generic-plan \
  --model-name /path/to/GLM-4.7-Flash \
  --topology-plan-samples 32 \
  --topology-min-stages 2 \
  --topology-max-stages 6 \
  --topology-tap-dropout 0.25 \
  --num-spec-layers 4 \
  --draft-top-k 4 \
  --upload-repo none
```

The command writes `topology/skippy-spd-topology-plan.json` under the run
artifact directory and exits before cloning or training. That exit is
intentional: the current reference implementation would otherwise produce a
fixed-stage head. The next model patch should consume these logical tap plans
with masks or tap dropout so one exported sidecar can be evaluated against many
candidate Skippy contiguous-layer topologies.

## Generic Layer-Tap Sidecar

`generic_layer_tap_sidecar.py` is the first non-donor sidecar path. It trains a
small token oracle over a set of logical hidden-state taps:

- `hidden[layer_index = 0]`: token embeddings before target layer 0
- `hidden[layer_index = k]`: output after target layer `k - 1`
- tap features: normalized layer depth plus an embedding-row flag
- tap mask/dropout: randomly withholds intermediate taps during training

The exported manifest uses:

- `source.format = generic-layer-tap-sidecar-v1`
- `topology.head_kind = generic-layer-tap-v1`
- serving tensors such as `tap_proj.*`, `depth_proj.*`, `tap_norm.*`,
  `output_norm.*`, and `draft_heads.{n}.*`

Run a local contract smoke without loading GLM:

```bash
uv run evals/spd/generic_layer_tap_sidecar.py \
  --smoke-synthetic \
  --work-dir /tmp/skippy-spd-generic-layer-tap-smoke \
  --model-name GLM-4.7-Flash-shape-only \
  --topology-num-hidden-layers 47 \
  --topology-plan-samples 8 \
  --topology-min-stages 2 \
  --topology-max-stages 4 \
  --topology-tap-dropout 0.25 \
  --num-spec-layers 2 \
  --draft-top-k 1 \
  --draft-vocab-size 64 \
  --synthetic-hidden-size 32 \
  --synthetic-vocab-size 128 \
  --synthetic-train-examples 48 \
  --synthetic-eval-examples 24 \
  --batch-size 8 \
  --epochs 1 \
  --device cpu \
  --export-dtype float32
```

Validate the exported generic manifest with Rust:

```bash
SKIPPY_SPD_MANIFEST=/tmp/skippy-spd-generic-layer-tap-smoke/artifacts/<run-id>/train/skippy-spd-head.json \
  cargo test -p skippy-runtime --lib \
  validates_external_manifest_when_skippy_spd_manifest_is_set
```

Run a small real GLM 4.7 quality gate by replacing `--smoke-synthetic` with the
local checkpoint path and small train/eval row counts first:

```bash
uv run evals/spd/generic_layer_tap_sidecar.py \
  --model-name /path/to/GLM-4.7-Flash \
  --work-dir /tmp/skippy-spd-glm47-generic-layer-tap-n1 \
  --train-rows 128 \
  --eval-rows 16 \
  --positions-per-row 4 \
  --max-length 512 \
  --num-spec-layers 1 \
  --draft-vocab-size 4096 \
  --topology-plan-samples 32 \
  --topology-min-stages 2 \
  --topology-max-stages 6 \
  --topology-tap-dropout 0.25 \
  --batch-size 8 \
  --epochs 1 \
  --device cuda \
  --export-dtype float16
```

## Reproduce Qwen3-0.6B Training

This is the smallest useful proof that the training path and artifact shape
work. It trains a real head from open data.

```bash
python evals/spd/hf_train_eval_qwen06.py \
  --work-dir /tmp/skippy-spd-qwen06-proof \
  --model-name Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --dataset HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k \
  --dataset-split train_sft \
  --train-rows 1024 \
  --eval-rows-per-set 8 \
  --num-stages 2 \
  --num-spec-layers 4 \
  --max-length 256 \
  --max-new-tokens 64 \
  --draft-top-k 4 \
  --device mps \
  --upload-repo none
```

Use `--device cuda` on a GPU host. The runner also supports HF Jobs, but that is
only a convenience wrapper; the proof is ordinary Python plus open data.

Recorded local result:

| Model | Head | Eval draft top-k | Generated tokens | Accepted flags | Acceptance | Equivalent accept length | Theoretical gain |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` | locally trained, 4 spec layers | 4 | 1536 | 326 / 1536 | 0.5628 | 1.1257 | 12.67% |

This proves the training/export path, but it is not the high-gain target.

## Reproduce Qwen3.5-4B Pretrained Head Eval

This is the strongest current model-quality signal. It uses an author-published
SPD head and evaluates it locally against the reference verifier.

```bash
python evals/spd/hf_train_eval_qwen06.py \
  --work-dir /tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4 \
  --model-name Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B \
  --spec-head-repo yuyijiong/speculative_pipeline_decoding \
  --spec-head-file Qwen3.5-4B_s4_l4.pt \
  --manifest-base-model-path Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B \
  --skip-train \
  --device mps \
  --eval-rows-per-set 8 \
  --max-new-tokens 64 \
  --draft-top-k 4 \
  --upload-repo none
```

Use `--device cuda` on a GPU host. The first run downloads the base model and
the SPD head.

Recorded local result:

| Model | Head | Eval draft top-k | Generated tokens | Accepted flags | Acceptance | Equivalent accept length | Theoretical gain |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B` | pretrained, 4 stages / 4 spec layers | 4 | 1536 | 1230 / 1536 | 0.6176 | 2.4704 | 163.39% |

Per-dataset theoretical gains from the same run:

| Dataset | Acceptance | Equivalent accept length | Theoretical gain |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| MT-Bench | 0.4918 | 1.9673 | 98.42% |
| HumanEval | 0.8797 | 3.5189 | 254.18% |
| GSM8K | 0.5926 | 2.3704 | 137.58% |

## Latency Simulation From Real Traces

`simulate_latency.py` consumes the raw `eval/raw/*per_sample.jsonl` file emitted
by the reference evaluator. It does not invent acceptance; it uses the real
`new_tokens`, `decode_loop_steps`, and accepted-flag counters from the run.

```bash
python evals/spd/simulate_latency.py \
  --raw /tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/<run-id>/eval/raw/pipeline_eval__train__speculation_head_final__nt24__per_sample.jsonl \
  --stage-ms 4,4,4,4 \
  --hop-ms 0,1,5,10,25
```

Recorded Qwen3.5-4B trace with a four-stage `4ms,4ms,4ms,4ms` model:

| Hop ms | Serial split tok/s | SPD pipeline tok/s | SPD vs serial split | Paper-like gain | P50 serial ms | P50 SPD ms |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 62.50 | 617.61 | 9.882x | 2.470x | 1024.00 | 106.50 |
| 1 | 52.63 | 494.09 | 9.388x | 2.470x | 1216.00 | 133.12 |
| 5 | 32.26 | 274.49 | 8.509x | 2.470x | 1984.00 | 239.62 |
| 10 | 21.74 | 176.46 | 8.117x | 2.470x | 2944.00 | 372.75 |
| 25 | 10.99 | 85.19 | 7.752x | 2.470x | 5824.00 | 772.12 |

The `paper-like gain` column is based on the SPD trace alone. The `SPD vs serial
split` column models a Skippy-specific comparison where ordinary split serving
must traverse every stage/hop for each generated token before the next target
token is known.

## Export the Serving Checkpoint

After training or downloading a reference SPD head, export the PyTorch
checkpoint to a Rust-readable serving artifact:

```bash
python evals/spd/export_spd_head.py \
  --checkpoint /tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/<run-id>/train/speculation_head_final.pt \
  --manifest /tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/<run-id>/train/skippy-spd-head.json \
  --base-model-path Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B
```

The exporter writes `spd-head.safetensors` next to the manifest and adds an
optional `serving_checkpoint` section to `skippy-spd-head.json`. The original
`.pt` checkpoint remains referenced for provenance.

Validate an exported local head through Rust with:

```bash
SKIPPY_SPD_MANIFEST=/tmp/skippy-spd-qwen35-4b-pretrained-s4l4/artifacts/<run-id>/train/skippy-spd-head.json \
  cargo test -p skippy-runtime validates_external_manifest_when_skippy_spd_manifest_is_set
```

## Artifact Contract

The proof runner writes:

- `train/speculation_head_final.pt`
- `train/spd-head.safetensors` after export
- `train/skippy-spd-head.json`
- `eval/raw/*.jsonl`
- `eval/summary/*.json`

The manifest schema is `skippy-spd-head/v1`. It binds a head checkpoint to:

- base model path/id
- checkpoint format/version
- checkpoint byte size and sha256
- hidden size
- base vocab size
- draft vocab size and optional draft token ids
- number of target stages
- number of spec layers
- shallow hidden-layer tap indices
- optional safetensors serving checkpoint path, size, checksum, tensor count,
  and dtype

Rust validation lives in `crates/skippy-runtime/src/spd.rs`.

## Next Engineering Steps

1. Add a tensor loader for the SPD head weights and draft vocab mapping.
2. Implement the Qwen3.5-4B SPD forward pass in Rust for the recorded topology.
3. Capture Skippy hidden-state taps and compare Rust top-k proposals to the
   Python reference on the same taps.
4. Wire live proposal generation into `skippy-server`.
5. Verify every accepted token through the normal target stages.
6. Use the Speedy benchmark for the final vanilla target versus verified
   target+SPD sidecar comparison; keep latency simulation as supporting
   analysis only.

## Next Research Steps

1. Train a head for a larger Qwen-family model to prove scaling beyond the
   pretrained 4B artifact.
2. Keep the draft vocab capped at 32k or 50k first.
3. Record acceptance, equivalent accept length, and latency simulation from the
   same eval prompts.
4. Only after that, evaluate custom large MoE targets. Very large MoE models
   need activation-capture support and are not the right first scaling proof.
