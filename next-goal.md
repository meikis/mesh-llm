# Next Goal: Improve Qwen480 S8 SPD Sidecar Quality

This file is disposable. Durable evidence belongs in `evals/spd/README.md` and
`docs/skippy/speculative_decoding.md`.

## One-Line Goal

Train and qualify a larger Qwen3-Coder-480B S8 native SPD sidecar on Hugging
Face, then only move to an HF meshlet if held-out package-backed serving shows
real candidate-token round-trip savings under the same logical topology.

## Current Checkpoint

- Latest completed HF Job: `meshllm/6a35cdc03093dba73ce2a9ad`.
- Artifact repo/path:
  `meshllm/skippy-spd-qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-ud-q4-k-xl-s8/runs/native-package-fresh`.
- Exact package:
  `meshllm/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-UD-Q4_K_XL-layers`.
- Logical topology: S8,
  `stage_layer_boundaries=8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62`.
- Required taps: `[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62]`.
- Smoke map used: `CPU,CUDA0,CPU,CUDA1,CPU,CUDA2,CPU,CUDA3`.
- Downloaded final reports:
  `/private/tmp/spd-qwen480-quality-final-json/`.
- Training scale: `512` train prompts x `4` verify steps = `2048` native-Q4
  train samples; `64` held-out prompts = `256` held-out samples.
- Held-out offline score: native-teacher top-1 `96 / 256`, top-4 `129 / 256`.
- Serving head: `8,723,214,136` bytes, SHA256
  `5cf3c15c54919414809cf409d252c5c4b0fa2b5ec084d91d4966e54976e75936`.

## Evidence From The Latest Broad Smoke

- Baseline/SPD content matched on `64 / 64` prompts.
- Tap return failures: `0`.
- Tap record failures: `0`.
- Ignored taps: `0`.
- Rolling proposals: `256` proposed, `0` accepted, `256` rejected.
- Optimistic tokens committed: `0`.
- Pipeline/economics: `0` saved versus `256` unsaved candidate-token round
  trips; latency simulation reports `paper_like_speedup_vs_serial_split=0.0`.
- Mean sidecar cost used by the latency simulator: about `395.8ms`.

Conclusion: the Qwen480 S8 request path, tap transport, package source, rolling
executor integration, and latency simulation path work at broad held-out scale.
The blocker remains sidecar quality from insufficient or insufficiently aligned
native-Q4 training data. Do not dispatch a meshlet for this sidecar.

## Prior Tiny Smoke Evidence

Previous HF Job: `meshllm/6a3593cf3093dba73ce2a78f`. Downloaded reports:
`/private/tmp/spd-qwen480-smoke-existing-completed/runs/native-package-fresh/`.

- Baseline/SPD content matched on `8 / 8` prompts.
- Tap return failures: `0`.
- Tap record failures: `0`.
- Ignored taps: `0`.
- Inline probes: `32 / 32` produced proposals.
- Proposal miss reasons: all `null`.
- Missing taps: none.
- Rolling proposals: `32` proposed, `0` accepted, `32` rejected.
- Optimistic tokens committed: `0`.
- Pipeline/economics: `0` saved versus `32` unsaved candidate-token round
  trips; `paper_like_speedup_vs_serial_split=0`.
- Held-out scorer for the tiny artifact: `2 / 8` top-1 and `5 / 8` top-4.
- Train summary overfit the tiny train set: `final_argmax_acc=1.0`,
  `sample_count=32`.
- Mean sidecar head time for pre-target probes: about `399.9ms`.
- Mean normal downstream wait in the smoke: about `1515.6ms`.

## Acceptance-Rate Focus

Do not spend the next iteration re-proving taps, package loading, or meshlet
lifecycle unless a new request-path failure appears.
The paper trains the frozen-target SPD speculation module with KL distillation
over about `1.2M` filtered samples from ShareGPT, UltraChat, SmolTalk, and
SmolTalk-Chinese, with max length `2048`, LR `1e-4`, linear decay, and one
epoch. The completed Qwen480 quality lane is only `2048` native-Q4 train samples,
so it is a first production-path quality signal, not sufficient paper-scale
evidence.

The next goal remains the same topology but with a larger native-Q4 KD/data
lane: broaden beyond UltraChat-only where practical, preserve a frozen
token-line-disjoint held-out gate, train from native verifier logits rather
than BF16 full-model teachers, and judge readiness by broad held-out
package-backed acceptance/economics before any HF meshlet.

## Success Gate

This goal is done only when a capped HF quality lane produces a larger trained
Qwen480 S8 sidecar and the package-backed held-out smoke shows:

- matched baseline/SPD content;
- zero tap return, tap record, and ignored-tap failures;
- nonzero accepted rolling proposals;
- more saved than unsaved candidate-token round trips.

If it clears that gate, the next goal becomes a short HF meshlet spike: run a
coordinator, local stage servers, the SPD sidecar, and OpenAI frontend as
separate processes inside one HF Job, optionally with artificial latency, to
validate lifecycle and pipeline economics before spending time on multi-HF-job
transport.

## Immediate Next Work

1. Submit the larger native-package-fresh quality profile only with explicit
   spend approval:
   - run on HF, not local M4;
   - same Qwen480 package and S8 topology;
   - train prompts at least `256`, preferably `512` if the cap still makes
     sense;
   - held-out prompts at least `64`;
   - verify steps `4`;
   - keep native package-first training and no full Qwen480 Transformers load;
   - print package, topology, prompt counts, hardware, timeout, output repo,
     and max cost.
   - Done: `/tmp/spd-qwen480-s8-quality-native-package-fresh-plan.json`,
     SHA256
     `563f142b265067cdda806a9f1ff29fa8743deddca51d48f2e9c829bc93972465`.
     The plan uses `512` train prompts, `64` held-out prompts, `4` verify
     steps, `rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `4.5h`, and max cost `$49.49991`.
2. Inspect the generated command graph and confirm it still avoids:
   - `AutoModelForCausalLM`;
   - `hf_train_eval_qwen06.py`;
   - `spd-live-tap-parity`;
   - warm-start/full-HF reference paths.
   - Done for the dry run above: `rg` found no matches for
     `AutoModelForCausalLM`, `hf_train_eval_qwen06`, `spd-live-tap-parity`, or
     `from_pretrained(`.
3. Before submitting spend, report the planned cap and expected risk:
   - `rtx-pro-6000x4` has worked mechanically and costs about `$11/hr`;
   - a `4.5h` timeout is about `$49.50`;
   - the risk is whether the larger capture/train/smoke reaches completion
     under the cap, not whether the old reference path is being used.
   - Submitted HF Job `meshllm/6a35cdc03093dba73ce2a9ad` after explicit
     spend approval. It is capped by the `4.5h` HF timeout on
     `rtx-pro-6000x4`, for planned max cost `$49.49991`.
   - Job input bundle:
     `job-inputs/20260619T231327Z-5b98182e/`, Hub revision
     `cf9e608e208f14708ebd826ce663dc607147fe6f`.
   - Patch SHA256:
     `9dda3b489a4a17b0cec69d892125613cd7a0b63177e5bc925e406d4d9af4c0bb`.
   - Launch env includes
     `SMOKE_STAGE_BACKEND_DEVICES=CPU,CUDA0,CPU,CUDA1,CPU,CUDA2,CPU,CUDA3`
     to avoid repeating the old two-stages-per-GPU package-smoke OOM.
4. Do not dispatch an HF meshlet yet. Meshlet is a follow-on only after
   package-backed held-out serving saves more candidate-token round trips than
   it wastes, with matched content and zero tap failures.

5. `meshllm/6a35cdc03093dba73ce2a9ad` completed and failed the
   acceptance/economics gate while mechanics stayed clean. Final downloaded
   reports:
   `/private/tmp/spd-qwen480-quality-final-json/openai-heldout-rolling.json`
   and
   `/private/tmp/spd-qwen480-quality-final-json/latency-simulation.json`.
   Evidence:
   - baseline/SPD content matched on `64 / 64` prompts;
   - tap return failures `0`, tap record failures `0`, ignored taps `0`;
   - rolling windows proposed `256`, accepted `0`, rejected `256`;
   - optimistic requests `64`, accepted `0`, committed `0`;
   - saved candidate-token round trips `0`, unsaved `256`;
   - latency simulation totals report `paper_like_speedup_vs_serial_split=0`;
   - mean measured sidecar cost used by the simulator was about `395.8ms`.
   Conclusion: this proves package-backed request mechanics at broad held-out
   scale, but the sidecar is still not qualified. Next spend must be a
   data/recipe scale-up, not a smoke-existing rerun or meshlet:
   - first larger target: at least `8k` to `16k` native-Q4 train samples if it
     fits a capped lane, with `64` to `256` held-out prompts;
   - longer target: move toward paper-scale mixed data if early scaling improves
     broad held-out acceptance;
   - keep KL against captured native draft-vocab logits as the core objective;
   - report offline top-1/top-4, package-backed accepted/proposed, saved/unsaved
     candidate-token round trips, and realistic latency simulation.
   - No-spend fallback dry run prepared:
     `/tmp/spd-qwen480-s8-quality-8k-native-package-fresh-paperlike-plan.json`,
     SHA256
     `981d7a95c314b14a7544250e6a6167a7fe42d64689fa4c08df4e98dfe453b646`.
     It uses the same Qwen480 S8 package/topology, `2048` train prompts with
     `4` verify steps (`8192` native-Q4 train samples), `128` held-out prompts,
     `physical-node-count=4`, capture map
     `CUDA0,CUDA0,CUDA1,CUDA1,CUDA2,CUDA2,CUDA3,CUDA3`, package-smoke map
     `CPU,CUDA0,CPU,CUDA1,CPU,CUDA2,CPU,CUDA3`, one epoch, LR `1e-4`,
     KL-only (`hard_label_weight=0`), `rtx-pro-6000x4`, `4.5h`, and planned
     max cost `$49.49991`. `rg` found no `AutoModelForCausalLM`,
     `hf_train_eval_qwen06`, `spd-live-tap-parity`, or `from_pretrained(` in
     the plan. Do not submit it until spend is explicitly approved.

## Why Not Meshlet Yet

The first single-job HF meshlet should validate process lifecycle, package
materialization, tap return, SPD proposal/verification, rolling cleanup, and
pipeline economics in one HF Job. It is useful only once there is a candidate
sidecar. The current sidecar proposes but accepts nothing, so a meshlet would
mostly re-measure known bad sidecar quality.
