# Next Goal: Resubmit Qwen3-Coder-480B S8 SPD HF Run With Two-Phase Capture

This file is disposable. Durable evidence belongs in `evals/spd/README.md` and
`docs/skippy/speculative_decoding.md`.

## One-Line Goal

Resubmit the capped Hugging Face native-package run for a Qwen3-Coder-480B S8
SPD sidecar after phase-separating full-verifier target/logit capture from
streamed tap-stage replay, using the exact MeshLLM Skippy layer package for
teacher capture and training only the SPD predictor from captured taps/logits.

## Immediate Target

- Runner: Hugging Face Jobs in the `meshllm` org.
- Spend cap for the first submitted job: `$50` maximum.
- No heavy local M4 training/capture loops for this target.
- Base/checkpoint family: `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct`.
- Exact package: `meshllm/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-UD-Q4_K_XL-layers`.
- Package model id: `unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`.
- Package size from `model-package.json`: `256.98 GiB`.
- Package shape from `model-package.json`: `62` layers, activation width `6144`.
- Vocab size for native capture: `151936` (`--vocab-size 151936`).
- Logical SPD topology: S8,
  `stage_layer_boundaries=8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62`.
- Required SPD taps: `[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62]`.
- Approx layer-package bytes by logical stage:
  `33.3,32.4,32.7,32.4,32.7,33.6,28.4,30.2 GiB`.

## Skippy Layers vs SPD Topology

SPD must reuse the normal Skippy layer package. It does not get a separate copy
of model layers.

- Skippy physical stages own actual layer ranges and package materialization.
- The SPD sidecar owns logical tap requirements and proposal weights.
- Workers need only the manifest-derived tap-return allowlist.
- The coordinator owns the SPD bundle and runs the predictor by default.
- If Mesh packs multiple logical SPD stages onto one physical node, that node
  must still return the internal logical-boundary taps required by the manifest.

This lets us predigest sidecars for canonical logical topologies such as S4,
S6, and S8 instead of training every possible physical host grouping.

## Cost-Capped First Lane

The first submitted lane should do as much real native-package work as possible
under `$50`, but it must not load the full HF base model through Transformers.
It should either produce a usable first sidecar or fail/expire with enough logs
to identify the next bottleneck.

Candidate HF flavors from the current Jobs hardware list:

- `rtx-pro-6000x4`: `384GB` VRAM, `1024GB` RAM, about `$11/hr`; cap around
  `4h30m` to stay under `$50`.
- `h200x2`: `282GB` VRAM, `512GB` RAM, about `$10/hr`; cap `5h`, but this is
  tight for a `256.98 GiB` package plus KV/runtime buffers.
- `h200x4`: `564GB` VRAM, `1024GB` RAM, about `$20/hr`; cap `2h30m`, more
  memory-safe but probably too short for a useful train/capture cycle.

First submitted target: `rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `4h30m`, max cost `$50`.
Latest failed retry target: `rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `3h30m`, max cost about
`$38.50`, chosen to keep aggregate spend for this lane under the original
`$50` intent after earlier failures. The next retry should use the same cap
unless a dry run changes the planned cost.

## Steps

1. Done: add a topology-only native-capture/bootstrap mode.
   - Inputs: package ref, S8 boundaries, hidden size, draft vocab, prompt shard.
   - Output: raw tap rows, native-Q4 teacher logits, row metadata, and a minimal
     topology shape.
   - It must not require an existing trained SPD head.
   - Implemented as `skippy-bench spd-product-corpus-capture`.
2. Done: add or wire a head-only trainer/scorer for captured native rows/logits.
   - It builds the SPD predictor from topology/config only.
   - It trains `stage_projs`, SPD layers, and draft-vocab head from raw rows.
   - Final norm is captured from the package and fixed, matching serving.
   - It must not instantiate `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct` with
     Transformers.
   - Implemented as `train_product_activation_head_only.py` and
     `score_product_activation_head_only.py`; both load AutoConfig only.
3. Done for serving, not parity: export and validate artifacts.
   - Emits `skippy-spd-head.json`, `spd-head.safetensors`, and
     `spd-serving-fixture.safetensors`.
   - Rust request-path serving can use the serving fixture for row metadata and
     final norm.
   - True Rust fixture parity is skipped for `native-package-fresh` until a
     native parity fixture exporter exists.
4. Planned inside the capped job: run package-backed local-on-HF smoke.
   - Use the same Qwen480 package directory and S8 split.
   - Check content match, tap failures, accepted/proposed counts, and
     saved/unsaved candidate-token round trips.
5. Planned inside the capped job: emit pipeline economics.
   - Run latency simulation for S8 clumped to 4 physical buckets and hop
     assumptions `0.2,1,5,10ms`.
   - Treat this as HF-side predictor/economics evidence, not LAN wall-clock
     proof.

## First Capped Run

```

Latest dry-run checkpoint after the capture-arg fix: this command resolves the package metadata as
`62` layers, activation width `6144`, package model id
`unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`, hardware
`rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `16200s`, and max cost `$49.49991`. The generated
native-package command graph contains no `AutoModelForCausalLM`, no
`hf_train_eval_qwen06.py`, no `spd-live-tap-parity`, and no warm-start path.
The generated `spd-product-corpus-capture` command now emits
`--product-native-teacher-logits true`, matching the native capture CLI's
`ArgAction::Set` boolean shape. The generated HF setup no longer asks pip to
upgrade/install `torch`; the PyTorch CUDA base image supplies it.
The current local dry run also emits
`--stage-backend-devices CUDA0,CUDA0,CUDA1,CUDA1,CUDA2,CUDA2,CUDA3,CUDA3` and
`--stream-live-tap-stages` for capture. Streaming preserves the existing full
native Q4 verifier session for teacher logits and opens only one tap-stage
model at a time, which is the planned fix for the `55..62` CUDA3 OOM.
The setup path now installs Rust/`just`/build prerequisites, detects the CUDA
architecture, builds the CUDA stage ABI with `just build-runtime`, and then
builds `target/release/skippy-bench` plus `target/release/skippy-server`.
Dispatch should use an HF-uploaded patch artifact via `MESH_LLM_PATCH_PATH`
instead of requiring a GitHub push from this machine.
`evals/spd/bootstrap_qwen480_s8_native_job.sh` is the job entrypoint for this:
it downloads the uploaded patch, applies it to a bootstrap clone, regenerates
the reviewed plan, then runs `run_hf_spd_qualification_plan.py`.

Latest failed job used the same parameters through an HF-uploaded
patch/bootstrap artifact, because the local branch was not pushed to GitHub from
this machine:

```

Failed streamed-capture resubmission used the same `$50` capped lane with the
streamed live-tap capture patch:

```bash

```

It failed after 209 seconds, before model work, because
`crates/skippy-server/src/frontend/spd.rs` still initialized
`SpdLiveTapRunnerConfig` without the new `stage_backend_devices` and
`stream_stages` fields. Commit `d19da20d` fixed that initializer. Commit
`f23e28ba` made the job timeout configurable so the retry could run shorter
than the original `4.5h` lane.

Failed streamed-capture retry used the fixed server config and a shorter
timeout:

```bash

```

It failed after reaching `capture[0]` because CUDA0 could not open streamed
tap stage `0..8` while the full verifier was still resident. Commit `3d1442f8`
changed `spd-product-corpus-capture` to a two-phase flow: record verifier
targets/native draft-vocab logits first, drop the verifier, then replay
contexts through streamed tap stages.

Current two-phase retry uses the `3d1442f8` patch artifact and the same shorter
timeout:

```bash

```

The timeout is the spending backstop. At the current checked rate for
`rtx-pro-6000x4`, `3.5h` plans at about `$38.50`; the job should finish, fail,
or be killed by HF at timeout. The first gate to watch is whether phase 2 can
open streamed tap stage `0..8` after the phase-1 verifier drop.

Startup attempts before the current live job:

- `meshllm/6a35304a953ed90bfb9446a8` failed in 3 seconds with exit `126`
  because the HF CLI invocation passed the multiline script to `bash` as a
  filename.
- `meshllm/6a3531c3953ed90bfb9446e2` failed the same way; root cause was
  missing the HF CLI `--` option terminator before container command flags, so
  `-lc` was parsed as a job label instead of a Bash argument.
- CPU canary `meshllm/6a3531e9953ed90bfb9446e4` proved the corrected
  `hf jobs run ... -- <image> bash -lc <script>` form and printed
  `hf-command-ok`.
- `meshllm/6a3532083093dba73ce2a204` reached the bootstrap script, cloned the
  repo, and failed in 16 seconds because `BOOTSTRAP_DIR` was not exported to
  the Python patch downloader. Fixed in commit `bcec1f4f`.
- `meshllm/6a35325c3093dba73ce2a206` reached patch apply and plan
  construction, then failed after 17 seconds because
  `/workspace/spd-qualification` did not exist before writing
  `native-package-fresh-plan.json`. Fixed in commit `861c2450`; the planner now
  creates `--out` parents, and bootstrap also creates `$WORK_DIR`.
- `meshllm/6a353427953ed90bfb944722` reached generated setup and failed after
  90 seconds at
  `MESH_LLM_SKIP_UI=1 MESH_LLM_BUILD_PROFILE=release just build-runtime backend=cuda cuda_arch="$CUDA_ARCH"`.
  The repo's `just build-runtime` recipe takes positional parameters, so the
  generated command must be `just build-runtime cuda "$CUDA_ARCH"`. Local dry
  run now emits the corrected command.
- `meshllm/6a3535603093dba73ce2a264` ran for 1189 seconds, passed CUDA
  `build-runtime`, built the Rust release binaries, downloaded the full
  Qwen480 package snapshot (`69` files, about `276G`), and built disjoint
  UltraChat prompt-token files (`512` train prompts, `64` held-out prompts,
  train mean `101.3` tokens, held-out mean `103.8` tokens). It failed at the
  first `spd-product-corpus-capture` command because the planner emitted
  `--product-native-teacher-logits` without the required `true` value. Local
  dry run now emits `--product-native-teacher-logits true`.
- `meshllm/6a353b9d3093dba73ce2a2bf` ran for 1249 seconds and cost about
  `$3.82` at the planned `$11/hr` rate. The command graph used the fixed
  `--product-native-teacher-logits true` argument, built CUDA/Rust release
  binaries, downloaded the full package, generated the `512`/`64` prompt shards,
  and reached `capture[0]`. It failed while opening topology-only package stage
  `55..62`: CUDA3 could not allocate a `30905.58 MiB` model buffer. This is a
  live-runner memory-residency issue, not another planner/reference-path issue.

Latest status check on 2026-06-19: job
`meshllm/6a3535603093dba73ce2a264` is `ERROR` with exit code `1`. It reached
real package download and prompt construction but did not start capture rows,
training, scoring, export, or smoke because of the fixed capture boolean
argument issue.

Status check on 2026-06-20 local time: streamed-capture job
`meshllm/6a354a2f953ed90bfb94486f` is `ERROR` after 1226 seconds. It cleared
inline bootstrap download/startup, CUDA ABI build, Rust release builds, Python
dependency setup, full 69-file Qwen480 layer-package download (`276G / 276G`),
and prompt-token shard building, then reached `capture[0]`. It failed opening
streamed tap stage `0..8`: CUDA0 could not allocate a `34051.88 MiB` buffer
while the full verifier remained resident.

Local fix checkpoint: `spd-product-corpus-capture` now runs target generation
and native draft-vocab logit capture first, drops the full verifier model, then
opens the streamed tap runner and replays the recorded contexts to write final
product rows. This preserves target/logit semantics while avoiding verifier and
tap-stage model residency overlap. A real cached package smoke passed against
`meshllm_Qwen3-0_6B-Q4_K_M-layers-test-main` with `--splits 14 --layer-end 28`,
`--stream-live-tap-stages`, one prompt, one verify step, native teacher logits,
and matching product row byte counts:
`/tmp/spd-two-phase-smoke-report.json`.

Cost status on 2026-06-20: before the latest streamed-capture retry, the two
serious Qwen480 jobs cost about `$7.45` combined (`1189s + 1249s` at about
`$11/hr`). Including the earlier streamed-build failure and the shorter startup
failures kept completed GPU spend for this lane around `$8` to `$9`; the latest
1226-second run adds about `$3.75`, putting completed GPU spend around
`$12` to `$13`. A new `3.5h` retry would still keep aggregate planned spend
under the original `$50` intent.

```

## Remaining Risks During Run

- The first HF run may expose a reference-code compatibility issue between
  `SpeculationHeadTransformer` and the Qwen3-Coder-480B MoE config. The
  current scripts deliberately load AutoConfig only, so this should fail early
  without loading the full model if unsupported.
- `native-package-fresh` exports a serving fixture, not a true Python/reference
  parity fixture. Do not claim Rust/Python fixture parity for this lane yet.
- Setup/build time runs inside the `3.5h` cap. If the job expires before useful
  capture, the next lane should reduce the first-run scope or use prebuilt
  runtime artifacts before increasing spend.
- Streamed tap capture trades peak VRAM for repeated stage opens. The next
  resubmission must report capture timing before deciding whether the reload
  churn fits the `$50` lane or requires a prebuilt/runtime or larger-memory
  follow-up lane.
- The two-phase fix relies on `StageModel` / `StageSession` drop returning CUDA
  buffers before phase 2 opens streamed tap stages. If CUDA allocator state
  still prevents a 34GiB stage allocation, the next fix should use a process
  boundary between verifier capture and tap replay or route tap replay to CPU.
- Because the run uses an uploaded patch artifact rather than a pushed branch,
  keep the run id, upload commit, and patch SHA with every report.

## Pass/Fail Gate

Pass for the capped lane means:

- the planner resolves the exact package, layer count, activation width, and S8
  tap topology;
- the chosen HF flavor and timeout stay under `$50`;
- train and held-out prompt-token shards are disjoint;
- package-backed staged load/capture starts on the S8 split;
- native teacher logits are captured over the SPD draft vocab;
- sidecar training starts from captured rows/logits without full HF base-model
  loading;
- exported artifacts pass serving-fixture validation if the run reaches export;
- Rust fixture parity is not expected in this lane until native parity fixture
  export is added;
- package-backed rolling smoke matches baseline content and has zero tap
  failures if the run reaches smoke;
- the report records accepted/proposed, saved/unsaved candidate-token round
  trips, sidecar timing, and latency simulation.

Do not call this a speedup or final sidecar-quality proof unless broad held-out
package-backed serving shows saved candidate-token round trips exceeding
unsaved round trips with margin.
