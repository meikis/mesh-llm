# Next Goal: Resubmit Qwen3-Coder-480B S8 SPD HF Run With Two-Phase Capture

This file is disposable. Durable evidence belongs in `evals/spd/README.md` and
`docs/skippy/speculative_decoding.md`.

## One-Line Goal

Resubmit the capped Hugging Face native-package run for a Qwen3-Coder-480B S8
SPD sidecar with two-phase full-verifier target/logit capture plus resident
tap-stage replay, using the exact MeshLLM Skippy layer package for teacher
capture and training only the SPD predictor from captured taps/logits.

## Immediate Target

- Runner: Hugging Face Jobs in the `meshllm` org.
- Spend cap for the first submitted job: `$50` maximum.
- No heavy local M4 training/capture loops for this target.
- Base/checkpoint family: `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct`.
- Exact package: `meshllm/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-UD-Q4_K_XL-layers`.
- Package model id: `unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`.
- Package size from `model-package.json`: `256.98 GiB`.
- Package shape from `model-package.json`: `62` layers, activation width `6144`.
- Vocab size for native capture: `151936` (`--vocab-size 151936`).
- Logical SPD topology: S8,
  `stage_layer_boundaries=8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62`.
- Required SPD taps: `[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62]`.
- Approx layer-package bytes by logical stage:
  `33.3,32.4,32.7,32.4,32.7,33.6,28.4,30.2 GiB`.

## Skippy Layers vs SPD Topology

SPD must reuse the normal Skippy layer package. It does not get a separate copy
of model layers.

- Skippy physical stages own actual layer ranges and package materialization.
- The SPD sidecar owns logical tap requirements and proposal weights.
- Workers need only the manifest-derived tap-return allowlist.
- The coordinator owns the SPD bundle and runs the predictor by default.
- If Mesh packs multiple logical SPD stages onto one physical node, that node
  must still return the internal logical-boundary taps required by the manifest.

This lets us predigest sidecars for canonical logical topologies such as S4,
S6, and S8 instead of training every possible physical host grouping.

## Cost-Capped First Lane

The first submitted lane should do as much real native-package work as possible
under `$50`, but it must not load the full HF base model through Transformers.
It should either produce a usable first sidecar or fail/expire with enough logs
to identify the next bottleneck.

Candidate HF flavors from the current Jobs hardware list:

- `rtx-pro-6000x4`: `384GB` VRAM, `1024GB` RAM, about `$11/hr`; cap around
  `4h30m` to stay under `$50`.
- `h200x2`: `282GB` VRAM, `512GB` RAM, about `$10/hr`; cap `5h`, but this is
  tight for a `256.98 GiB` package plus KV/runtime buffers.
- `h200x4`: `564GB` VRAM, `1024GB` RAM, about `$20/hr`; cap `2h30m`, more
  memory-safe but probably too short for a useful train/capture cycle.

First submitted target: `rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `4h30m`, max cost `$50`.
Latest failed retry target: `rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `3h30m`, max cost about
`$38.50`, chosen to keep aggregate spend for this lane under the original
`$50` intent after earlier failures. The next retry should use the same cap
unless a dry run changes the planned cost.

## Steps

1. Done: add a topology-only native-capture/bootstrap mode.
   - Inputs: package ref, S8 boundaries, hidden size, draft vocab, prompt shard.
   - Output: raw tap rows, native-Q4 teacher logits, row metadata, and a minimal
     topology shape.
   - It must not require an existing trained SPD head.
   - Implemented as `skippy-bench spd-product-corpus-capture`.
2. Done: add or wire a head-only trainer/scorer for captured native rows/logits.
   - It builds the SPD predictor from topology/config only.
   - It trains `stage_projs`, SPD layers, and draft-vocab head from raw rows.
   - Final norm is captured from the package and fixed, matching serving.
   - It must not instantiate `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct` with
     Transformers.
   - Implemented as `train_product_activation_head_only.py` and
     `score_product_activation_head_only.py`; both load AutoConfig only.
3. Done for serving, not parity: export and validate artifacts.
   - Emits `skippy-spd-head.json`, `spd-head.safetensors`, and
     `spd-serving-fixture.safetensors`.
   - Rust request-path serving can use the serving fixture for row metadata and
     final norm.
   - True Rust fixture parity is skipped for `native-package-fresh` until a
     native parity fixture exporter exists.
4. Planned inside the capped job: run package-backed local-on-HF smoke.
   - Use the same Qwen480 package directory and S8 split.
   - Check content match, tap failures, accepted/proposed counts, and
     saved/unsaved candidate-token round trips.
5. Planned inside the capped job: emit pipeline economics.
   - Run latency simulation for S8 clumped to 4 physical buckets and hop
     assumptions `0.2,1,5,10ms`.
   - Treat this as HF-side predictor/economics evidence, not LAN wall-clock
     proof.

## Follow-On HF Meshlet Spike

Do not dispatch a separate HF meshlet while the Qwen480 sidecar job is still
trying to produce its first usable artifacts. The meshlet becomes the next
short spike only after the current lane has enough evidence to carry:

- held-out native teacher summaries exist and have coherent in-scope target
  coverage;
- training/scoring completed or failed with an actionable quality result;
- the serving bundle exported;
- package-backed rolling `spd-openai-smoke` matched baseline content, recorded
  zero tap failures, and reported useful accepted/proposed plus saved/unsaved
  candidate-token round trips.

When those gates clear, run the first HF meshlet as one HF Job, not multiple HF
Jobs: start a coordinator, stage-server processes, SPD sidecar, and OpenAI
frontend as separate local processes inside the job, with optional synthetic
per-stage latency. Success for that spike is process lifecycle, package
materialization, tap return, SPD proposal/verification, rolling cleanup, and a
repeatable pipeline-economics report. Multiple HF Jobs with exposed ports are a
later transport spike, not the first end-to-end validation path.

## First Capped Run

Planner dry run used before submission:

```bash

```

Latest dry-run checkpoint after the capture-arg fix: this command resolves the package metadata as
`62` layers, activation width `6144`, package model id
`unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`, hardware
`rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `16200s`, and max cost `$49.49991`. The generated
native-package command graph contains no `AutoModelForCausalLM`, no
`hf_train_eval_qwen06.py`, no `spd-live-tap-parity`, and no warm-start path.
The generated `spd-product-corpus-capture` command now emits
`--product-native-teacher-logits true`, matching the native capture CLI's
`ArgAction::Set` boolean shape. The generated HF setup no longer asks pip to
upgrade/install `torch`; the PyTorch CUDA base image supplies it.
The current local dry run also emits
`--stage-backend-devices CUDA0,CUDA0,CUDA1,CUDA1,CUDA2,CUDA2,CUDA3,CUDA3` and
`--stream-live-tap-stages` for capture. Streaming preserves the existing full
native Q4 verifier session for teacher logits and opens only one tap-stage
model at a time, which is the planned fix for the `55..62` CUDA3 OOM.
The setup path now installs Rust/`just`/build prerequisites, detects the CUDA
architecture, builds the CUDA stage ABI with `just build-runtime`, and then
builds `target/release/skippy-bench` plus `target/release/skippy-server`.
Dispatch should use an HF-uploaded patch artifact via `MESH_LLM_PATCH_PATH`
instead of requiring a GitHub push from this machine.
`evals/spd/bootstrap_qwen480_s8_native_job.sh` is the job entrypoint for this:
it downloads the uploaded patch, applies it to a bootstrap clone, regenerates
the reviewed plan, then runs `run_hf_spd_qualification_plan.py`.

Latest failed job used the same parameters through an HF-uploaded
patch/bootstrap artifact, because the local branch was not pushed to GitHub from
this machine:

streamed live-tap capture patch:

```

It failed after 209 seconds, before model work, because
`crates/skippy-server/src/frontend/spd.rs` still initialized
`SpdLiveTapRunnerConfig` without the new `stage_backend_devices` and
`stream_stages` fields. Commit `d19da20d` fixed that initializer. Commit
`f23e28ba` made the job timeout configurable so the retry could run shorter
than the original `4.5h` lane.

Failed streamed-capture retry used the fixed server config and a shorter
timeout:

```bash

```

It failed after reaching `capture[0]` because CUDA0 could not open streamed
tap stage `0..8` while the full verifier was still resident. Commit `3d1442f8`
changed `spd-product-corpus-capture` to a two-phase flow: record verifier
targets/native draft-vocab logits first, drop the verifier, then replay
contexts through live tap stages.

The first two-phase retry used the `3d1442f8` patch artifact and the same
shorter timeout:

```bash

```

It was manually canceled after proving the old allocator failure point but
before timeout. It completed release `skippy-bench`/`skippy-server` builds,
downloaded the full Qwen480 layer-package snapshot (`276G / 276G`, `69`
files), built the prompt dataset shards, entered native capture, and logged the
streamed stage `0..8` allocation as
`CUDA0 model buffer size = 34051.88 MiB` instead of failing with `cudaMalloc`.
The reason for canceling was not a correctness failure: code inspection showed
`--stream-live-tap-stages` reopens all eight tap stages for each prompt/step,
so `512` train prompts plus `64` held-out prompts at `4` verify steps would
burn the cap on repeated stage-open churn before training or smoke.

Next retry: keep the two-phase verifier drop but run resident tap stages, not
streamed tap stages. The previous resident OOM happened while the full verifier
was still loaded; after phase 1 exits, the resident S8 tap stages should fit on
`rtx-pro-6000x4` with the existing device map. The planner now defaults to
resident tap stages and only emits `--stream-live-tap-stages` when explicitly
requested.

First artifact-producing profile for the next retry:

```bash
TRAIN_PROMPTS=32
HELDOUT_PROMPTS=8
VERIFY_STEPS=1
STREAM_LIVE_TAP_STAGES=false
JOB_TIMEOUT=2h
```

The matching dry run resolves resident tap capture, `rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout
`7200s`, max cost about `$22`, no `AutoModelForCausalLM`, no
`hf_train_eval_qwen06.py`, no `spd-live-tap-parity`, and no
`--stream-live-tap-stages`. Treat this as a mechanics/artifact lane, not final
sidecar quality. If resident stages fit and this reaches capture/train/export
smoke, raise the row count in a later capped quality lane.

Submitted resident-small retry:

The job is labeled `spd-qwen480-resident-small` and was submitted with
`TRAIN_PROMPTS=32`, `HELDOUT_PROMPTS=8`, `VERIFY_STEPS=1`,
`STREAM_LIVE_TAP_STAGES=false`, and `JOB_TIMEOUT=2h`.

Observed resident-small result: it failed after `1424s` running, but only after
the important mechanics gates cleared. The job completed release build,
downloaded the full `69`-file / `276G` package snapshot, built prompts, loaded
the full Qwen480 verifier across four RTX PRO 6000 GPUs, phase-separated
verifier capture from tap replay, opened resident S8 tap stages, converted
train and held-out native corpora, trained the head-only predictor, scored
held-out, and exported an `8.72GB` BF16 serving head. Train had `32` samples
with `31 / 32` labels in draft scope; held-out had `8 / 8` labels in scope.
Head-only training reported `base_model_load=skipped`, final hard-label
accuracy `1.0` on the tiny train set, and held-out `2 / 8` top-1 plus `5 / 8`
top-4. The failure was a generated shell quoting bug in the
`rust_fixture_parity` skip command: the script ran `echo ...; Rust fixture ...`,
so Bash tried to execute `Rust` and exited `127`.

Next retry: resubmit the same resident-small profile with the generator fixed
to emit the parity-skip message as one `printf` command. Local validation
passes for `python3 -m py_compile` on the planner/runner, the same 32/8/1 dry
run, and `run_hf_spd_qualification_plan.py --groups rust_fixture_parity`. The
first new gate is package-backed rolling smoke and upload, because capture,
train, score, and export already worked once.

```

The job is labeled `spd-qwen480-resident-small-fixed` and uses the same
`TRAIN_PROMPTS=32`, `HELDOUT_PROMPTS=8`, `VERIFY_STEPS=1`,
`STREAM_LIVE_TAP_STAGES=false`, and `JOB_TIMEOUT=2h` profile. At submission it
was scheduling. First gate: it should replay the already-proven capture path,
then continue past `rust_fixture_parity` into package smoke and upload.

Observed fixed resident-small result: the job is `ERROR` after `1383s` running,
but it passed the prior parity-skip failure and repeated the useful native
mechanics gates. It again completed build, full `69`-file / `276G` package
download, Qwen480 verifier load, two-phase verifier capture plus resident tap
replay, native train/held-out conversion, head-only training, held-out scoring,
and BF16 serving export. Held-out score was again `2 / 8` top-1 and `5 / 8`
top-4. The export SHA was
`3fcdb93eeea5d23c4ae3df3dc39e10e70f59564a2ab20820f09aa0a7a5fe3f9d`.
The new failure is package-backed smoke readiness: `baseline OpenAI frontend
did not become ready`, with `127.0.0.1:<port>/v1/models` returning connection
refused. Because upload was still after smoke, the expensive sidecar artifact
was not durably uploaded by that job.

Local fix checkpoint for the next retry: `spd-openai-smoke` now collects and
prints bounded stage-log tails after OpenAI readiness failure, the
`native-package-fresh` plan uploads artifacts in `upload_pre_smoke` before
package smoke, and native-package smoke now uses
`--startup-timeout-secs 600 --request-timeout-secs 600` with
`--work-dir /workspace/spd-qualification/artifact/openai-smoke-work`. The local
32/8/1 dry run resolves `rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `7200s`, max cost
`$21.99996`, S8 boundaries `8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62`, no
`AutoModelForCausalLM`, no `hf_train_eval_qwen06.py`, no `spd-live-tap-parity`,
and no `--stream-live-tap-stages`. The generated smoke command includes the
600s timeouts and artifact-owned work dir, and the command graph includes
`upload_pre_smoke` before `package_smoke`.

This job is labeled `spd-qwen480-resident-small-observable`, uses
`rtx-pro-6000x4`, `TRAIN_PROMPTS=32`, `HELDOUT_PROMPTS=8`, `VERIFY_STEPS=1`,
`STREAM_LIVE_TAP_STAGES=false`, and `JOB_TIMEOUT=2h`. First gates: reach
`upload_pre_smoke` after export, then either pass package smoke or fail with
stage-log tails showing why the baseline OpenAI frontend did not bind.

Startup attempts before the latest two-phase retry:

- `meshllm/6a35304a953ed90bfb9446a8` failed in 3 seconds with exit `126`
  because the HF CLI invocation passed the multiline script to `bash` as a
  filename.
- `meshllm/6a3531c3953ed90bfb9446e2` failed the same way; root cause was
  missing the HF CLI `--` option terminator before container command flags, so
  `-lc` was parsed as a job label instead of a Bash argument.
- CPU canary `meshllm/6a3531e9953ed90bfb9446e4` proved the corrected
  `hf jobs run ... -- <image> bash -lc <script>` form and printed
  `hf-command-ok`.
- `meshllm/6a3532083093dba73ce2a204` reached the bootstrap script, cloned the
  repo, and failed in 16 seconds because `BOOTSTRAP_DIR` was not exported to
  the Python patch downloader. Fixed in commit `bcec1f4f`.
- `meshllm/6a35325c3093dba73ce2a206` reached patch apply and plan
  construction, then failed after 17 seconds because
  `/workspace/spd-qualification` did not exist before writing
  `native-package-fresh-plan.json`. Fixed in commit `861c2450`; the planner now
  creates `--out` parents, and bootstrap also creates `$WORK_DIR`.
- `meshllm/6a353427953ed90bfb944722` reached generated setup and failed after
  90 seconds at
  `MESH_LLM_SKIP_UI=1 MESH_LLM_BUILD_PROFILE=release just build-runtime backend=cuda cuda_arch="$CUDA_ARCH"`.
  The repo's `just build-runtime` recipe takes positional parameters, so the
  generated command must be `just build-runtime cuda "$CUDA_ARCH"`. Local dry
  run now emits the corrected command.
- `meshllm/6a3535603093dba73ce2a264` ran for 1189 seconds, passed CUDA
  `build-runtime`, built the Rust release binaries, downloaded the full
  Qwen480 package snapshot (`69` files, about `276G`), and built disjoint
  UltraChat prompt-token files (`512` train prompts, `64` held-out prompts,
  train mean `101.3` tokens, held-out mean `103.8` tokens). It failed at the
  first `spd-product-corpus-capture` command because the planner emitted
  `--product-native-teacher-logits` without the required `true` value. Local
  dry run now emits `--product-native-teacher-logits true`.
- `meshllm/6a353b9d3093dba73ce2a2bf` ran for 1249 seconds and cost about
  `$3.82` at the planned `$11/hr` rate. The command graph used the fixed
  `--product-native-teacher-logits true` argument, built CUDA/Rust release
  binaries, downloaded the full package, generated the `512`/`64` prompt shards,
  and reached `capture[0]`. It failed while opening topology-only package stage
  `55..62`: CUDA3 could not allocate a `30905.58 MiB` model buffer. This is a
  live-runner memory-residency issue, not another planner/reference-path issue.

Latest status check on 2026-06-19: job
`meshllm/6a3535603093dba73ce2a264` is `ERROR` with exit code `1`. It reached
real package download and prompt construction but did not start capture rows,
training, scoring, export, or smoke because of the fixed capture boolean
argument issue.

Status check on 2026-06-20 local time: streamed-capture job
`meshllm/6a354a2f953ed90bfb94486f` is `ERROR` after 1226 seconds. It cleared
inline bootstrap download/startup, CUDA ABI build, Rust release builds, Python
dependency setup, full 69-file Qwen480 layer-package download (`276G / 276G`),
and prompt-token shard building, then reached `capture[0]`. It failed opening
streamed tap stage `0..8`: CUDA0 could not allocate a `34051.88 MiB` buffer
while the full verifier remained resident.

Local fix checkpoint: `spd-product-corpus-capture` now runs target generation
and native draft-vocab logit capture first, drops the full verifier model, then
opens the streamed tap runner and replays the recorded contexts to write final
product rows. This preserves target/logit semantics while avoiding verifier and
tap-stage model residency overlap. A real cached package smoke passed against
`meshllm_Qwen3-0_6B-Q4_K_M-layers-test-main` with `--splits 14 --layer-end 28`,
`--stream-live-tap-stages`, one prompt, one verify step, native teacher logits,
and matching product row byte counts:
`/tmp/spd-two-phase-smoke-report.json`.

Cost status on 2026-06-20: before the latest streamed-capture retry, the two
serious Qwen480 jobs cost about `$7.45` combined (`1189s + 1249s` at about
`$11/hr`). Including the earlier streamed-build failure and the shorter startup
failures kept completed GPU spend for this lane around `$8` to `$9`; the latest
1226-second run adds about `$3.75`, putting completed GPU spend around
`$12` to `$13`. A new `3.5h` retry would still keep aggregate planned spend
under the original `$50` intent.

## Remaining Risks During Run

- The first HF run may expose a reference-code compatibility issue between
  `SpeculationHeadTransformer` and the Qwen3-Coder-480B MoE config. The
  current scripts deliberately load AutoConfig only, so this should fail early
  without loading the full model if unsupported.
- `native-package-fresh` exports a serving fixture, not a true Python/reference
  parity fixture. Do not claim Rust/Python fixture parity for this lane yet.
- Setup/build time runs inside the timeout cap. If the job expires before
  useful capture, the next lane should reduce the first-run scope further or
  use prebuilt runtime artifacts before increasing spend.
- Resident tap capture should remove the streamed per-sample stage-open churn,
  but it must prove that all S8 tap stages fit after the phase-1 verifier has
  been dropped. The next resubmission must report capture timing before raising
  row counts.
- The two-phase fix relies on `StageModel` / `StageSession` drop returning CUDA
  buffers before phase 2 opens resident tap stages. If CUDA allocator state or
  resident stage memory still prevents allocation, the next fix should use a
  process boundary between verifier capture and tap replay, restore streamed
  capture for a much smaller row count, or move to a larger-memory lane.
- Because the run uses an uploaded patch artifact rather than a pushed branch,
  keep the run id, upload commit, and patch SHA with every report.

## Pass/Fail Gate

Pass for the capped lane means:

- the planner resolves the exact package, layer count, activation width, and S8
  tap topology;
- the chosen HF flavor and timeout stay under `$50`;
- train and held-out prompt-token shards are disjoint;
- package-backed staged load/capture starts on the S8 split;
- native teacher logits are captured over the SPD draft vocab;
- sidecar training starts from captured rows/logits without full HF base-model
  loading;
- exported artifacts pass serving-fixture validation if the run reaches export;
- Rust fixture parity is not expected in this lane until native parity fixture
  export is added;
- package-backed rolling smoke matches baseline content and has zero tap
  failures if the run reaches smoke;
- the report records accepted/proposed, saved/unsaved candidate-token round
  trips, sidecar timing, and latency simulation.

Do not call this a speedup or final sidecar-quality proof unless broad held-out
package-backed serving shows saved candidate-token round trips exceeding
unsaved round trips with margin.
