# Next Goal: Qwen3-Coder-480B S8 SPD HF Plan

This file is disposable. Durable evidence belongs in `evals/spd/README.md` and
`docs/skippy/speculative_decoding.md`.

## One-Line Goal

Review and then explicitly dispatch a capped Hugging Face native-package run
for a Qwen3-Coder-480B S8 SPD sidecar, using the exact MeshLLM Skippy layer
package for teacher capture and training only the SPD predictor from captured
taps/logits.

## Immediate Target

- Runner: Hugging Face Jobs in the `meshllm` org.
- Spend cap for the first submitted job: `$50` maximum.
- No heavy local M4 training/capture loops for this target.
- Base/checkpoint family: `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct`.
- Exact package: `meshllm/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-UD-Q4_K_XL-layers`.
- Package model id: `unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`.
- Package size from `model-package.json`: `256.98 GiB`.
- Package shape from `model-package.json`: `62` layers, activation width `6144`.
- Vocab size for native capture: `151936` (`--vocab-size 151936`).
- Logical SPD topology: S8,
  `stage_layer_boundaries=8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62`.
- Required SPD taps: `[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62]`.
- Approx layer-package bytes by logical stage:
  `33.3,32.4,32.7,32.4,32.7,33.6,28.4,30.2 GiB`.

## Skippy Layers vs SPD Topology

SPD must reuse the normal Skippy layer package. It does not get a separate copy
of model layers.

- Skippy physical stages own actual layer ranges and package materialization.
- The SPD sidecar owns logical tap requirements and proposal weights.
- Workers need only the manifest-derived tap-return allowlist.
- The coordinator owns the SPD bundle and runs the predictor by default.
- If Mesh packs multiple logical SPD stages onto one physical node, that node
  must still return the internal logical-boundary taps required by the manifest.

This lets us predigest sidecars for canonical logical topologies such as S4,
S6, and S8 instead of training every possible physical host grouping.

## Cost-Capped First Lane

The first submitted lane should do as much real native-package work as possible
under `$50`, but it must not load the full HF base model through Transformers.
It should either produce a usable first sidecar or fail/expire with enough logs
to identify the next bottleneck.

Candidate HF flavors from the current Jobs hardware list:

- `rtx-pro-6000x4`: `384GB` VRAM, `1024GB` RAM, about `$11/hr`; cap around
  `4h30m` to stay under `$50`.
- `h200x2`: `282GB` VRAM, `512GB` RAM, about `$10/hr`; cap `5h`, but this is
  tight for a `256.98 GiB` package plus KV/runtime buffers.
- `h200x4`: `564GB` VRAM, `1024GB` RAM, about `$20/hr`; cap `2h30m`, more
  memory-safe but probably too short for a useful train/capture cycle.

Preferred first dry-run target: `rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `4h30m`, max cost
`$50`.

## Steps

1. Done: add a topology-only native-capture/bootstrap mode.
   - Inputs: package ref, S8 boundaries, hidden size, draft vocab, prompt shard.
   - Output: raw tap rows, native-Q4 teacher logits, row metadata, and a minimal
     topology shape.
   - It must not require an existing trained SPD head.
   - Implemented as `skippy-bench spd-product-corpus-capture`.
2. Done: add or wire a head-only trainer/scorer for captured native rows/logits.
   - It builds the SPD predictor from topology/config only.
   - It trains `stage_projs`, SPD layers, and draft-vocab head from raw rows.
   - Final norm is captured from the package and fixed, matching serving.
   - It must not instantiate `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct` with
     Transformers.
   - Implemented as `train_product_activation_head_only.py` and
     `score_product_activation_head_only.py`; both load AutoConfig only.
3. Done for serving, not parity: export and validate artifacts.
   - Emits `skippy-spd-head.json`, `spd-head.safetensors`, and
     `spd-serving-fixture.safetensors`.
   - Rust request-path serving can use the serving fixture for row metadata and
     final norm.
   - True Rust fixture parity is skipped for `native-package-fresh` until a
     native parity fixture exporter exists.
4. Planned inside the capped job: run package-backed local-on-HF smoke.
   - Use the same Qwen480 package directory and S8 split.
   - Check content match, tap failures, accepted/proposed counts, and
     saved/unsaved candidate-token round trips.
5. Planned inside the capped job: emit pipeline economics.
   - Run latency simulation for S8 clumped to 4 physical buckets and hop
     assumptions `0.2,1,5,10ms`.
   - Treat this as HF-side predictor/economics evidence, not LAN wall-clock
     proof.

## First Capped Run

After the patch above, run a planner dry run, no submission:

```bash
python3 evals/spd/plan_hf_spd_qualification.py \
  --base-model Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct \
  --package-ref meshllm/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-UD-Q4_K_XL-layers \
  --qualification-mode native-package-fresh \
  --num-stages 8 \
  --stage-layer-boundaries 8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62 \
  --num-spec-layers 4 \
  --draft-top-k 4 \
  --draft-vocab-size 32000 \
  --vocab-size 151936 \
  --dataset HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k \
  --dataset-split train_sft \
  --train-prompts 512 \
  --heldout-prompts 64 \
  --max-prompt-tokens 480 \
  --verify-steps 4 \
  --ctx-size 1024 \
  --physical-node-count 4 \
  --logical-stage-ms 40 \
  --hop-ms 0.2,1,5,10 \
  --flavor rtx-pro-6000x4 \
  --timeout 4.5h \
  --max-cost-usd 50 \
  --output-repo meshllm/skippy-spd-qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-ud-q4-k-xl-s8 \
  --out /tmp/spd-qwen480-s8-native-package-fresh-plan.json \
  --json
```

Latest dry-run checkpoint: this command resolves the package metadata as
`62` layers, activation width `6144`, package model id
`unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`, hardware
`rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `16200s`, and max cost `$49.49991`. The generated
native-package command graph contains no `AutoModelForCausalLM`, no
`hf_train_eval_qwen06.py`, no `spd-live-tap-parity`, and no warm-start path.
The setup path now installs Rust/`just`/build prerequisites, detects the CUDA
architecture, builds the CUDA stage ABI with `just build-runtime`, and then
builds `target/release/skippy-bench` plus `target/release/skippy-server`.
Dispatch should use an HF-uploaded patch artifact via `MESH_LLM_PATCH_PATH`
instead of requiring a GitHub push from this machine.
`evals/spd/bootstrap_qwen480_s8_native_job.sh` is the job entrypoint for this:
it downloads the uploaded patch, applies it to a bootstrap clone, regenerates
the reviewed plan, then runs `run_hf_spd_qualification_plan.py`.

The submitted job should use the same parameters and:

```bash
hf jobs run \
  --namespace meshllm \
  --flavor rtx-pro-6000x4 \
  --timeout 4.5h \
  --secrets HF_TOKEN \
  --detach \
  <docker-image> \
  bash run-qwen480-s8-native-spd.sh
```

The timeout is the spending backstop. At the current checked rate for
`rtx-pro-6000x4`, `4.5h` plans at about `$49.50`; the job should finish, fail,
or be killed by HF at timeout.

## Remaining Risks Before Dispatch

- The first HF run may expose a reference-code compatibility issue between
  `SpeculationHeadTransformer` and the Qwen3-Coder-480B MoE config. The
  current scripts deliberately load AutoConfig only, so this should fail early
  without loading the full model if unsupported.
- `native-package-fresh` exports a serving fixture, not a true Python/reference
  parity fixture. Do not claim Rust/Python fixture parity for this lane yet.
- The generated plan is dry-run only. Spend-bearing submit still needs explicit
  confirmation and should keep the `4.5h` timeout as the hard cost backstop.

## Pass/Fail Gate

Pass for the capped lane means:

- the planner resolves the exact package, layer count, activation width, and S8
  tap topology;
- the chosen HF flavor and timeout stay under `$50`;
- train and held-out prompt-token shards are disjoint;
- package-backed staged load/capture starts on the S8 split;
- native teacher logits are captured over the SPD draft vocab;
- sidecar training starts from captured rows/logits without full HF base-model
  loading;
- exported artifacts pass serving-fixture validation if the run reaches export;
- Rust fixture parity is not expected in this lane until native parity fixture
  export is added;
- package-backed rolling smoke matches baseline content and has zero tap
  failures if the run reaches smoke;
- the report records accepted/proposed, saved/unsaved candidate-token round
  trips, sidecar timing, and latency simulation.

Do not call this a speedup or final sidecar-quality proof unless broad held-out
package-backed serving shows saved candidate-token round trips exceeding
unsaved round trips with margin.
