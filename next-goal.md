# Next Goal: Resubmit Qwen3-Coder-480B S8 SPD HF Run With Streamed Capture

This file is disposable. Durable evidence belongs in `evals/spd/README.md` and
`docs/skippy/speculative_decoding.md`.

## One-Line Goal

Resubmit the capped Hugging Face native-package run for a Qwen3-Coder-480B S8
SPD sidecar after checkpointing the streamed live-tap capture fix, using the
exact MeshLLM Skippy layer package for teacher capture and training only the
SPD predictor from captured taps/logits.

## Immediate Target

- Runner: Hugging Face Jobs in the `meshllm` org.
- Spend cap for the first submitted job: `$50` maximum.
- No heavy local M4 training/capture loops for this target.
- Base/checkpoint family: `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct`.
- Exact package: `meshllm/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-UD-Q4_K_XL-layers`.
- Package model id: `unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`.
- Package size from `model-package.json`: `256.98 GiB`.
- Package shape from `model-package.json`: `62` layers, activation width `6144`.
- Vocab size for native capture: `151936` (`--vocab-size 151936`).
- Logical SPD topology: S8,
  `stage_layer_boundaries=8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62`.
- Required SPD taps: `[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,55,62]`.
- Approx layer-package bytes by logical stage:
  `33.3,32.4,32.7,32.4,32.7,33.6,28.4,30.2 GiB`.

## Skippy Layers vs SPD Topology

SPD must reuse the normal Skippy layer package. It does not get a separate copy
of model layers.

- Skippy physical stages own actual layer ranges and package materialization.
- The SPD sidecar owns logical tap requirements and proposal weights.
- Workers need only the manifest-derived tap-return allowlist.
- The coordinator owns the SPD bundle and runs the predictor by default.
- If Mesh packs multiple logical SPD stages onto one physical node, that node
  must still return the internal logical-boundary taps required by the manifest.

This lets us predigest sidecars for canonical logical topologies such as S4,
S6, and S8 instead of training every possible physical host grouping.

## Cost-Capped First Lane

The first submitted lane should do as much real native-package work as possible
under `$50`, but it must not load the full HF base model through Transformers.
It should either produce a usable first sidecar or fail/expire with enough logs
to identify the next bottleneck.

Candidate HF flavors from the current Jobs hardware list:

- `rtx-pro-6000x4`: `384GB` VRAM, `1024GB` RAM, about `$11/hr`; cap around
  `4h30m` to stay under `$50`.
- `h200x2`: `282GB` VRAM, `512GB` RAM, about `$10/hr`; cap `5h`, but this is
  tight for a `256.98 GiB` package plus KV/runtime buffers.
- `h200x4`: `564GB` VRAM, `1024GB` RAM, about `$20/hr`; cap `2h30m`, more
  memory-safe but probably too short for a useful train/capture cycle.

Submitted first target: `rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `4h30m`, max cost `$50`.

## Steps

1. Done: add a topology-only native-capture/bootstrap mode.
   - Inputs: package ref, S8 boundaries, hidden size, draft vocab, prompt shard.
   - Output: raw tap rows, native-Q4 teacher logits, row metadata, and a minimal
     topology shape.
   - It must not require an existing trained SPD head.
   - Implemented as `skippy-bench spd-product-corpus-capture`.
2. Done: add or wire a head-only trainer/scorer for captured native rows/logits.
   - It builds the SPD predictor from topology/config only.
   - It trains `stage_projs`, SPD layers, and draft-vocab head from raw rows.
   - Final norm is captured from the package and fixed, matching serving.
   - It must not instantiate `Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct` with
     Transformers.
   - Implemented as `train_product_activation_head_only.py` and
     `score_product_activation_head_only.py`; both load AutoConfig only.
3. Done for serving, not parity: export and validate artifacts.
   - Emits `skippy-spd-head.json`, `spd-head.safetensors`, and
     `spd-serving-fixture.safetensors`.
   - Rust request-path serving can use the serving fixture for row metadata and
     final norm.
   - True Rust fixture parity is skipped for `native-package-fresh` until a
     native parity fixture exporter exists.
4. Planned inside the capped job: run package-backed local-on-HF smoke.
   - Use the same Qwen480 package directory and S8 split.
   - Check content match, tap failures, accepted/proposed counts, and
     saved/unsaved candidate-token round trips.
5. Planned inside the capped job: emit pipeline economics.
   - Run latency simulation for S8 clumped to 4 physical buckets and hop
     assumptions `0.2,1,5,10ms`.
   - Treat this as HF-side predictor/economics evidence, not LAN wall-clock
     proof.

```

Latest dry-run checkpoint after the capture-arg fix: this command resolves the package metadata as
`62` layers, activation width `6144`, package model id
`unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`, hardware
`rtx-pro-6000x4`, timeout `16200s`, and max cost `$49.49991`. The generated
native-package command graph contains no `AutoModelForCausalLM`, no
`hf_train_eval_qwen06.py`, no `spd-live-tap-parity`, and no warm-start path.
The generated `spd-product-corpus-capture` command now emits
`--product-native-teacher-logits true`, matching the native capture CLI's
`ArgAction::Set` boolean shape. The generated HF setup no longer asks pip to
upgrade/install `torch`; the PyTorch CUDA base image supplies it.
The current local dry run also emits
`--stage-backend-devices CUDA0,CUDA0,CUDA1,CUDA1,CUDA2,CUDA2,CUDA3,CUDA3` and
`--stream-live-tap-stages` for capture. Streaming preserves the existing full
native Q4 verifier session for teacher logits and opens only one tap-stage
model at a time, which is the planned fix for the `55..62` CUDA3 OOM.
The setup path now installs Rust/`just`/build prerequisites, detects the CUDA
architecture, builds the CUDA stage ABI with `just build-runtime`, and then
builds `target/release/skippy-bench` plus `target/release/skippy-server`.
Dispatch should use an HF-uploaded patch artifact via `MESH_LLM_PATCH_PATH`
instead of requiring a GitHub push from this machine.
`evals/spd/bootstrap_qwen480_s8_native_job.sh` is the job entrypoint for this:
it downloads the uploaded patch, applies it to a bootstrap clone, regenerates
the reviewed plan, then runs `run_hf_spd_qualification_plan.py`.

Latest failed job used the same parameters through an HF-uploaded
patch/bootstrap artifact, because the local branch was not pushed to GitHub from
this machine:

```

The timeout is the spending backstop. At the current checked rate for
`rtx-pro-6000x4`, `4.5h` plans at about `$49.50`; the job should finish, fail,
or be killed by HF at timeout.

Startup attempts before the current live job:

- `meshllm/6a35304a953ed90bfb9446a8` failed in 3 seconds with exit `126`
  because the HF CLI invocation passed the multiline script to `bash` as a
  filename.
- `meshllm/6a3531c3953ed90bfb9446e2` failed the same way; root cause was
  missing the HF CLI `--` option terminator before container command flags, so
  `-lc` was parsed as a job label instead of a Bash argument.
- CPU canary `meshllm/6a3531e9953ed90bfb9446e4` proved the corrected
  `hf jobs run ... -- <image> bash -lc <script>` form and printed
  `hf-command-ok`.
- `meshllm/6a3532083093dba73ce2a204` reached the bootstrap script, cloned the
  repo, and failed in 16 seconds because `BOOTSTRAP_DIR` was not exported to
  the Python patch downloader. Fixed in commit `bcec1f4f`.
- `meshllm/6a35325c3093dba73ce2a206` reached patch apply and plan
  construction, then failed after 17 seconds because
  `/workspace/spd-qualification` did not exist before writing
  `native-package-fresh-plan.json`. Fixed in commit `861c2450`; the planner now
  creates `--out` parents, and bootstrap also creates `$WORK_DIR`.
- `meshllm/6a353427953ed90bfb944722` reached generated setup and failed after
  90 seconds at
  `MESH_LLM_SKIP_UI=1 MESH_LLM_BUILD_PROFILE=release just build-runtime backend=cuda cuda_arch="$CUDA_ARCH"`.
  The repo's `just build-runtime` recipe takes positional parameters, so the
  generated command must be `just build-runtime cuda "$CUDA_ARCH"`. Local dry
  run now emits the corrected command.
- `meshllm/6a3535603093dba73ce2a264` ran for 1189 seconds, passed CUDA
  `build-runtime`, built the Rust release binaries, downloaded the full
  Qwen480 package snapshot (`69` files, about `276G`), and built disjoint
  UltraChat prompt-token files (`512` train prompts, `64` held-out prompts,
  train mean `101.3` tokens, held-out mean `103.8` tokens). It failed at the
  first `spd-product-corpus-capture` command because the planner emitted
  `--product-native-teacher-logits` without the required `true` value. Local
  dry run now emits `--product-native-teacher-logits true`.
- `meshllm/6a353b9d3093dba73ce2a2bf` ran for 1249 seconds and cost about
  `$3.82` at the planned `$11/hr` rate. The command graph used the fixed
  `--product-native-teacher-logits true` argument, built CUDA/Rust release
  binaries, downloaded the full package, generated the `512`/`64` prompt shards,
  and reached `capture[0]`. It failed while opening topology-only package stage
  `55..62`: CUDA3 could not allocate a `30905.58 MiB` model buffer. This is a
  live-runner memory-residency issue, not another planner/reference-path issue.

Latest status check on 2026-06-19: job
`meshllm/6a3535603093dba73ce2a264` is `ERROR` with exit code `1`. It reached
real package download and prompt construction but did not start capture rows,
training, scoring, export, or smoke because of the fixed capture boolean
argument issue.

Current status check on 2026-06-19: streamed-capture job
`meshllm/6a354843953ed90bfb944848` is `RUNNING`. It has cleared inline
bootstrap download/startup and is in generated setup after apt package install
and Rust toolchain download. It has not yet reached package download, capture,
training, scoring, export, or smoke.

Cost status on 2026-06-19: before the current streamed-capture run, the two
serious Qwen480 jobs cost about `$7.45` combined (`1189s + 1249s` at about
`$11/hr`). Including the shorter startup failures keeps completed GPU spend for
this lane under about `$8`. The current run is capped separately by the same
`4.5h` / about `$49.50` timeout.

```

## Remaining Risks During Run

- The first HF run may expose a reference-code compatibility issue between
  `SpeculationHeadTransformer` and the Qwen3-Coder-480B MoE config. The
  current scripts deliberately load AutoConfig only, so this should fail early
  without loading the full model if unsupported.
- `native-package-fresh` exports a serving fixture, not a true Python/reference
  parity fixture. Do not claim Rust/Python fixture parity for this lane yet.
- Setup/build time runs inside the `4.5h` cap. If the job expires before useful
  capture, the next lane should reduce the first-run scope or use prebuilt
  runtime artifacts before increasing spend.
- Streamed tap capture trades peak VRAM for repeated stage opens. The next
  resubmission must report capture timing before deciding whether the reload
  churn fits the `$50` lane or requires a prebuilt/runtime or larger-memory
  follow-up lane.
- Because the run uses an uploaded patch artifact rather than a pushed branch,
  keep the run id, upload commit, and patch SHA with every report.

## Pass/Fail Gate

Pass for the capped lane means:

- the planner resolves the exact package, layer count, activation width, and S8
  tap topology;
- the chosen HF flavor and timeout stay under `$50`;
- train and held-out prompt-token shards are disjoint;
- package-backed staged load/capture starts on the S8 split;
- native teacher logits are captured over the SPD draft vocab;
- sidecar training starts from captured rows/logits without full HF base-model
  loading;
- exported artifacts pass serving-fixture validation if the run reaches export;
- Rust fixture parity is not expected in this lane until native parity fixture
  export is added;
- package-backed rolling smoke matches baseline content and has zero tap
  failures if the run reaches smoke;
- the report records accepted/proposed, saved/unsaved candidate-token round
  trips, sidecar timing, and latency simulation.

Do not call this a speedup or final sidecar-quality proof unless broad held-out
package-backed serving shows saved candidate-token round trips exceeding
unsaved round trips with margin.
