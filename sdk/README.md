# SDK

This directory contains the language-specific Mesh SDK packages built on top of
the shared native node SDK.

Current SDKs:

- `swift/` for Apple platforms
- `kotlin/` for Android and JVM consumers
- `node/` for Node.js and Electron consumers

These SDK packages should stay thin. Shared node behavior belongs in the Rust
SDK crates:

- `crates/mesh-client/` for the low-level client implementation
- `crates/mesh-llm-api/` for the public Rust SDK API while the node SDK is being
  reworked
- `crates/mesh-llm-node/` for embeddable model management and serving
  orchestration. Serving SDK calls should bind to in-process node
  controllers, not the local REST management API.
- `crates/mesh-llm-ffi/` for the UniFFI/native bridge used by Swift and Kotlin
- `crates/mesh-llm-nodejs/` for the N-API native bridge used by Node.js

The SDK's long-term public surface is `MeshNode`: one embedded node that can
consume inference from the mesh, manage local models, serve local models, or
combine those roles. See `docs/design/EMBEDDED_CLIENT_ADR.md` for the current
SDK direction.

The customer-facing SDK usage guide lives in `docs/SDK.md`. SDK changes should
keep Rust, Swift, Kotlin, and Node aligned around real examples, polished
lifecycle, typed errors, and an honest platform support matrix.

Generated UniFFI bindings and Apple binary artifacts are build outputs, not
source. Do not check in `sdk/*/Generated`, generated `uniffi/mesh_ffi` Kotlin
sources, or `MeshLLMFFI.xcframework`; regenerate them from
`crates/mesh-llm-ffi/src/mesh_ffi.udl` in local builds and CI.

If you add another top-level SDK here, include a `README.md` in that SDK
directory explaining its packaging and public surface.
