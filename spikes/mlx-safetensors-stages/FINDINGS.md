# SafeTensors stage-local download and adaptive MLX quantization

## Status

Metadata planning, exact-range materialization, and two-stage MLX execution
proofs completed on 2026-07-17. The frontier-model measurements inspect headers
only; the SmolLM2 proof downloads and executes selected tensor payloads.

The standalone `mlx-safetensors-stage-plan` spike proves that a layer server can:

1. read `model.safetensors.index.json`;
2. select only tensors owned by its layer range;
3. fetch the 8-byte length and JSON header from each relevant SafeTensors file;
4. turn each tensor's `data_offsets` into absolute HTTP byte ranges; and
5. stream those ranges into a valid partial `model.safetensors` artifact.

It refuses a response other than HTTP `206 Partial Content`, preventing an
ignored `Range` header from silently downloading a multi-gigabyte shard.

## Bottom line

SafeTensors supports the desired model: canonical upstream weights remain on
Hugging Face, while each layer server downloads and caches only the tensors it
owns. A separately published layer-package repository is not required.

For normally ordered checkpoints, selecting whole shard files already gets
close to exact. For Inkling, tensors are heavily interleaved across source
shards, so exact tensor ranges are mandatory: whole-shard selection would turn
a 109.84 GiB four-layer stage into a 942.99 GiB download.

The small dense-model path is now proven through execution. The remaining
artifact proof is bounded-memory tensor-at-a-time MLX quantization for a source
tensor too large to retain alongside a whole BF16 stage.

## Reproduce

```bash
just mlx-safetensors-stage-plan \
  --repo thinkingmachines/Inkling \
  --revision 86b4d430ab871652a707666b89203a866888c5e5 \
  --layer-start 30 \
  --layer-end 34
```

Use `--json` for the per-shard byte ranges. Additional tensors can be assigned
with repeated `--include-prefix` arguments; for example the first stage can own
the embedding and modality towers, while the final stage owns final norm,
readout, and optional MTP tensors.

Without `--output`, the CLI fetches only the index and SafeTensors headers. With
`--output <dir>`, it fetches the selected payload ranges, writes
`model.safetensors`, `config.json`, and a reproducible `stage-plan.json`, and
still refuses any payload response other than HTTP 206.

## Small-model execution proof

`HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` at immutable revision
`12fd25f77366fa6b3b4b768ec3050bf629380bac` was split unnecessarily at layer 15:

| Stage | Owned tensors | Exact payload | Whole checkpoint | Avoided locally | HTTP payload spans |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0: embedding + layers 0..15 | 136 | 155.28 MiB | 256.60 MiB | 101.28 MiB | 3 |
| 1: layers 15..30 + norm + tied embedding | 137 | 155.28 MiB | 256.60 MiB | 101.28 MiB | 4 |

The tied embedding is intentionally duplicated: stage 0 uses it for token
input, while stage 1 uses it as the tied output projection. Neither stage file
contains the complete checkpoint. A strict whole-model baseline is assembled
from the union of the two partial files, so the parity test cannot silently
fall back to a full download.

The `mlx-split-proof` harness runs layers 0..15 and 15..30 as separate MLX
stages, serializes the residual through Skippy's real `StageWireMessage` binary
codec, maintains independent per-stage KV caches, and compares against unsplit
execution. Prompt prefill plus eight greedy decode steps passed on Metal with
both F16 and F32 wire encodings:

- identical eight-token sequence: `284, 260, 2240, 314, 1343, 327, 624, 8685`;
- worst maximum absolute logit delta: `0.0` for F16 and F32; and
- F16 total stage-wire traffic: 15,584 bytes for the tested prefill and decode.

One important engine contract emerged: after decoding F16/F32 wire bytes, the
receiving MLX stage must cast the residual back to the model's compute dtype
(BF16 here) before its first block. Leaving the reconstructed array as F32
changed Metal arithmetic and immediately changed the greedy token, despite
identical numeric boundary values.

Reproduction uses the two materializer invocations followed by:

```bash
just mlx-safetensors-split-proof \
  --stage0 /tmp/mlx-split-smol/stage0 \
  --stage1 /tmp/mlx-split-smol/stage1 \
  --split 15 \
  --steps 8 \
  --wire-dtype f16
```

This proves the artifact, MLX layer-range, KV-cache, and existing binary
activation-frame seams on one Mac. It is not yet a two-process/two-node
`mesh-llm serve` implementation; `skippy-server` still binds directly to the
llama.cpp `StageModel` and needs the planned engine abstraction first.

## Representative measurements

All rows select four middle transformer layers. Layer types vary within hybrid
models, so the table demonstrates storage locality rather than equal compute.

The format mechanism is stable and documented by the
[SafeTensors format](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors#format): the
header records each tensor's dtype, shape, and byte offsets. Hugging Face's
[Xet download protocol](https://huggingface.co/docs/xet/download-protocol#range-downloads)
supports partial-file reconstruction, and the public `resolve` endpoint honored
the byte ranges in every probe above.

## Inkling as the frontier stress test

[Inkling](https://huggingface.co/thinkingmachines/Inkling) is a 975B-total,
41B-active, 66-layer multimodal MoE with:

- 256 routed experts, with 6 selected per token, plus 2 shared experts;
- 6144-wide residual states;
- relative-position attention rather than RoPE;
- a 5:1 sliding-window/global-attention pattern;
- four short-convolution states per decoder layer;
- text, vision, and audio inputs;
- a 1,048,576-token maximum context; and
- eight optional MTP predictor layers.

The source artifacts are:

| Artifact | Exact tensor bytes | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `thinkingmachines/Inkling` | 1,904,604,285,204 | Canonical BF16; 109 weight files plus index |
| `thinkingmachines/Inkling-NVFP4` | 591,854,374,368 | Official calibrated NVFP4; intended for Blackwell-class serving stacks |
| `mlx-community/Inkling-mlx-4bit` | 560,463,783,044 | Text-only mixed MLX affine-4 experiment |

The community MLX artifact is useful size evidence, but it is not yet a runnable
or certified answer for mesh-llm. Its own model card says the custom Inkling
forward is not registered in upstream `mlx-lm`, logits are not numerically
verified, and the vision/audio towers are excluded. The repository contains
weights and tokenizer/config files but not the custom model implementation.

Neither upstream `mlx-lm` nor the pinned Rust `safemlx-lm` dependency currently
ships an Inkling family. The authoritative reference implementation is now in
[Transformers' Inkling model](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/inkling/modular_inkling.py).

### What an Inkling MLX stage engine must implement

1. Text-decoder parity first: relative-logit attention, local/global masks,
   query scaling, sigmoid top-k routing, routed and shared experts, and all four
   SConv paths.
2. A stage constructor that creates only `layers[start..end]`, with embeddings
   on the first stage and final norm/readout on the last.
3. Stage-local KV plus SConv recurrent state. Inkling cannot be treated as a
   plain paged-KV Llama family.
4. An Inkling-specific weight loader and quantization predicate.
5. Logit parity against Transformers at several layer cuts before network work.
6. Vision/audio towers on the first stage after the text chain is certified.
7. MTP as a separate optional capability after ordinary decode is correct.

The residual-stream boundary remains clean between decoder layers, so these
features make family bring-up substantial but do not invalidate pipeline
splitting.

## Hardware-adaptive quantization

The user's proposed model is viable: choose a quantization plan after topology
and hardware discovery, then quantize only each server's selected tensors during
cold load. MLX directly supports affine 2/3/4/5/6/8-bit quantization with group
sizes 32/64/128, plus MXFP4, MXFP8, and NVFP4. It also accepts a per-module
predicate, allowing sensitive modules and different layer ranges to retain more
precision. See [`mlx.core.quantize`](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/python/_autosummary/mlx.core.quantize.html)
and [`mlx.nn.quantize`](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/build/html/python/nn/_autosummary/mlx.nn.quantize.html).

For Inkling, start with the community conversion's conservative policy:

- quantize routed-expert matrices only;
- keep attention, router, shared experts, embeddings, normalization, relative
  projections, and SConv weights in BF16;
- use affine 4-bit, group size 64; and
- never derive an MLX quant from the official NVFP4 artifact when BF16 is
  available, because that would be a lossy requantization.

The measured 4-bit artifact and MLX affine storage formula imply approximately
1.870 TB of BF16 source tensors are quantizable and 34.5 GB remain BF16. Holding
the same predicate constant gives these rough storage targets:

| Routed-expert affine precision | Estimated total weights |
| --- | ---: |
| 2-bit, group 64 | 304 GiB |
| 3-bit, group 64 | 413 GiB |
| 4-bit, group 64 | 522 GiB (matches measured artifact) |
| 5-bit, group 64 | 631 GiB |
| 6-bit, group 64 | 740 GiB |
| 8-bit, group 64 | 957 GiB |

These are capacity estimates, not quality endorsements. Two- and three-bit
profiles need evaluation, and the current community 4-bit artifact itself is
not yet logit-verified. MLX's sensitivity-based dynamic quantization can produce
mixed-bit profiles, but for a frontier model the sensitivity result should be
computed and certified once per model revision, stored as a small profile, and
then applied deterministically by every stage. Recomputing sensitivity during
every cold load would be too expensive.

Different stages may use different precision when hardware differs. The chosen
per-stage profile must be part of the topology/model identity so that a cached
stage is reproducible and correctness evidence names the exact numeric model.

### Cold-load memory contract

Load-time quantization only makes small nodes viable if it is streamed. For
Inkling layers 30..33:

- BF16 input ranges: 109.84 GiB;
- resulting mixed affine-4 stage: 32.22 GiB; and
- largest single BF16 source tensor: 18.00 GiB.

A whole-stage loader would need BF16 input plus quantized output and fail on a
128 GB node. A tensor-streaming loader can keep the accumulated 32.22 GiB target
plus one source tensor and quantization scratch resident. The cold path should:

1. range-fetch one tensor into a bounded temporary/mmap buffer;
2. create the MLX source array;
3. quantize according to the certified per-tensor profile;
4. evaluate and append the packed tensor/scales/biases to the derived cache;
5. release the BF16 source buffer; and
6. continue with the next tensor.

The same rule applies to disk: do not retain an entire BF16 stage unless the
operator asks for it. A derived cache can approach `quantized stage + largest
source tensor`, rather than `BF16 stage + quantized stage`.

### Approximate Inkling 4-bit deployment shapes

The 521.97 GiB text-weight artifact plus Inkling's long-context cache and load
scratch makes aggregate memory, not raw model size alone, the constraint.
At full 1M context, BF16 KV is approximately 44 GiB: eleven global-attention
layers each retain about 4 GiB, while the 55 sliding layers retain only their
512-token windows (about 220 MiB combined). SConv state is comparatively small.

Assuming balanced stages and the 18 GiB largest source tensor:

| Topology | Weight share/node | Assessment before measured runtime overhead |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| 2 × 512 GB | ~261 GiB | Comfortable capacity; simplest plausible full-context shape |
| 3 × 256 GB | ~174 GiB | Comfortable capacity |
| 4 × 192 GB | ~131 GiB | Plausible |
| 5 × 128 GB | ~104 GiB | Too tight once 18 GiB load scratch and KV are included |
| 6 × 128 GB | ~87 GiB | Plausible but needs measured allocator/kernel headroom |
| 8 × 128 GB | ~65 GiB | Safer first 128 GB-node target |
| 12 × 64 GB | ~44 GiB | Too tight during 18 GiB source-tensor quantization |
| 16 × 64 GB | ~33 GiB | Plausible capacity; stage latency may dominate |

Shorter context materially reduces the KV portion. These are feasibility
estimates, not throughput claims; MoE dispatch performance, per-stage latency,
and the MLX boundary fence still need measurement.

## Frontier-family prioritization

SafeTensors acquisition is general, but MLX execution remains family-specific.
The measured candidates suggest this order:

1. **Qwen/Llama**: finish the partial loader and two-stage correctness proof.
2. **Nemotron 3 Ultra**: best next frontier proof because `safemlx-lm` already
   has a Nemotron-H implementation, although its Mamba/recurrent blocks still
   require state-boundary certification.
3. **Inkling text backbone**: high-value new family; use the upstream
   Transformers modular implementation as the parity oracle.
4. **Inkling multimodal + MTP**: add first-stage towers and optional predictor
   layers after text correctness.
5. **Kimi K2.6, GLM-5.2, DeepSeek V4**: all are viable range-download targets,
   but each requires a new or substantially updated MLX family and native
   support for its existing compressed format or a canonical BF16 source.

Not every frontier repository should be requantized at load. Kimi K2.6's
published checkpoint is already about 554 GiB, and DeepSeek V4 Pro is already
FP8. Preserve a compatible calibrated source encoding when the local backend
supports it; use BF16-to-local-quant only when it is the cleanest compatible
source path.

## Recommended artifact identity

The durable identity should be:

```text
source repo + immutable revision
+ selected tensor names and source byte ranges
+ model-family implementation revision
+ stage range / embedding / readout / modality ownership
+ per-stage quantization profile
+ activation wire dtype
= derived stage cache identity
```

The cache is evictable derived data. The upstream checkpoint remains the source
of truth, and a small certified quantization/profile manifest replaces a large
published layer-package repository.

## Next proof

1. Stream BF16 tensor -> MLX affine quant -> partial SafeTensors output one
   tensor at a time; prove bounded RSS and disk use.
2. Measure the MLX eval/readback/codec boundary fence independently at frontier
   residual widths and prefill sizes.
3. Introduce the engine-neutral stage interface and run the same proof through
   two real `skippy-server` processes.
4. Repeat the loader proof with Nemotron-H before implementing Inkling.
5. Port Inkling's text decoder to `safemlx-lm`, starting with one layer and
   Transformers parity, then stage ranges, then network execution.
